    No event bus, no file I/O, no imports from events.*, no clock reads.
    `resets_at` is carried through verbatim for DISPLAY ONLY -- it is never
    read to decide whether a window has "recovered". A live capture showed
    anthropic's weekly resets_at a day in the past while used_pct was still
    100.0; branching on resets_at would have wrongly suppressed that finding.
    Recovery (usage dropping back down) is Phase 1 episode-machinery
    business, wired up in Task 2 -- not this function's job.
