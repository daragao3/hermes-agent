# purely in presentation: a twelve-day-old percentage rendered indistinguishably
# from a fresh one, so the failure was invisible for twelve days.

# WHY 24 HOURS. The windows these rows carry are 5-hourly, weekly and monthly. A

# NOTHING: no snapshot, no diagnostics, just a stale ai-tokens.json. The 90s
# only ever bounded the tail of an unbounded prefix.

# -- the historical constant stands, so nothing regresses.
#
# This is strictly a TIGHTENING mechanism. The result is capped at the
