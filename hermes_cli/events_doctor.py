# Two checkouts on this box ARE production and can silently run stale code:
#
#   ~/.hermes/agent-src (trunk `main`)   — the gateway's editable install
#     imports its WORKING TREE, which is kept on a detached HEAD so worktree
#     agents can land commits onto `main` via `git branch -f`.  A commit
#     landed on main does NOT run until the checkout is fast-forwarded and
#     the gateway restarted — on 2026-07-20/21 three restart cycles ran
#     stale code because every session believed "main tip moved" meant live.
#
#   ~/.hermes (trunk `master`)           — cron script slots and Windows
#     Scheduled Tasks resolve ABSOLUTE paths under ~/.hermes/scripts/,
#     ~/.hermes/profiles/*/scripts/ and ~/.hermes/ops/, so only the working
#     tree runs.  On 2026-07-28, 62 commits sat undeployed for three days
#     behind a clean `git status`.
#
# Trunk ref names differ per repo and ~/.hermes has NO `main` branch, so the
# trunk is configured alongside the path — see the loud-vs-skip note in
# check_code_drift().
#
# Both the watched-repo registry AND the git probe itself come from the
# CODE_DRIFT producer: this file renders, it does not probe.  The duplicate
# probe it used to carry is what let the unresolvable-trunk blind spot exist
# in two places at once.

    """Compare a deployed checkout's HEAD against its configured trunk ref.

    Read-only -- never mutates the repo.  Returns the number of issues found
    (0 or 1).

    RENDERS the CODE_DRIFT producer's ``sample_code_drift()``; it does not
    probe git itself.  Until 2026-07-28 this function carried its own
    near-duplicate copy of that probe (`_git`, `_agent_src_root`, a
    hardcoded `refs/heads/main`), and BOTH copies independently degraded an
    unresolvable trunk ref to a quiet skip.  That is the failure mode worth
    designing against: a blind spot fixed in one surface and left open in
    the other is worse than one fixed nowhere, because the surface that got
    fixed is then cited as proof the box is clean.  One probe, two
    renderings -- so the hole cannot be reopened by halves.

    Deliberately NOT gated by WatchedRepo.executed_dirs, unlike the
    event-bus producer -- note ``executed_dirs=()`` below.  The producer
    narrows ALERTS so a phone does not buzz for inert docs churn; this is a
    diagnostic the operator ran on purpose, so it reports every divergence
    and lets them judge.  Sharing the probe does not mean sharing the alert
    policy: the gate is a parameter of the probe, so this surface simply
    declines it.

    Skip vs FAIL, the 2026-07-28 lesson: an absent checkout or transient git
    failure degrades to a skip/no-op so the monitor never fabricates drift or
    recovery. Once HEAD resolves, a missing configured trunk is unambiguous
    and returns ``trunk_missing`` as a loud issue.
