"""hermes install-doctor — detect drift between DECLARED and INSTALLED packages.

``pyproject.toml`` declares the packages the project ships. The editable
finder in site-packages is a SEPARATE artifact, generated once at install
time and never regenerated as packages are added. Those are different
properties, and until this module only the first was tested.

On 2026-08-10 the installed finder held 18 of the 23 declared top-level
packages. ``events/subscribers/jobflow_dispatcher.py`` imports
``jobflow_dispatch`` at module level and ``events/gateway_integration.py``
imports that subscriber at module level, so from any cwd outside agent-src
the chain raised ModuleNotFoundError and took down all 13 event-bus
subscribers. The running gateway was healthy only because it happened to
have been launched from agent-src.

THE FALSIFIER IS A NEUTRAL CWD. From inside agent-src every package
resolves via cwd and the drift is invisible.

This lives in a doctor command rather than a pytest test on purpose: it
asserts a property of the developer's ENVIRONMENT, not of the repo. As a
test it would have to skip for anyone who has not reinstalled, and would
then silently no-op for every developer and in CI — checking the property
only where it already holds. The checker's logic is covered instead by
tests/hermes_cli/test_install_doctor.py, which is hermetic and never skips.
