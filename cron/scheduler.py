# ============================================================================
# AGENT_ITERATION — generic per-agent run summary (2026-04-30)
#
# Extends the TAILOR_ITERATION pattern to every cron-driven agent. Each
# agent's SOUL.md contracts it to emit an <AGENT_ITERATION_JSON>{...}</AGENT_
# ITERATION_JSON> block at the end of its cron output. The cron-wrapper
# extracts and emits a structured EventType.AGENT_ITERATION event.
#
# Why generic vs. one EventType per agent: a single envelope keeps the
# Critic's analyzer surface small (one event-type to query) and lets agents
# evolve their counter schemas without bus.py changes. Per-agent topic
# routing (AGENT_TOPIC_MAP in telegram_notifier.py) puts the message in the
# right Telegram surface based on payload.agent.
#
# Schema (validated by _extract_agent_iteration):
#   agent (str, required)        — canonical lowercase agent name
#   summary (str, required)      — one-line human-readable text (≤200 chars)
#   counters (dict, optional)    — agent-specific metrics
#   anomalies (list, optional)   — list of dicts/strings flagged for Critic
#   reason (str, optional)       — categorical reason (e.g. "no_work")
#
# Failure modes are explicit AGENT_ERROR events so a regression in any
# agent's prompt is observable on the bus rather than silently dropped.
#
# Agent-name override (2026-04-30): the LLM-supplied ``agent`` field is
# overridden with ``canonical_agent_source(job_name)`` whenever the job
# name maps to a known canonical identity.  This makes per-agent topic
# routing (AGENT_TOPIC_MAP in telegram_notifier.py) deterministic
# instead of dependent on the LLM picking the right name for its role
# each run.  The original LLM choice is preserved as
# ``agent_llm_supplied`` for audit/debugging.  Jobs without a canonical
# mapping fall back to the LLM-supplied name.  See
# docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-30-agent-iteration-canonical-name.md.
#
# Marker-missing fallback (2026-04-30): when a known canonical agent's
# job omits the ``<AGENT_ITERATION_JSON>`` marker entirely, a placeholder
# event is synthesized so 100% of canonical-agent runs leave an audit
# trail (devflow-bridge was observed dropping the marker on ~46% of
# runs).  Synthesized payloads carry ``synthesized: True`` so downstream
# consumers (Critic, dashboards) can filter or weight them differently
# from real LLM-emitted iterations.  Jobs without a canonical mapping
# remain silent — we do not synthesize for ad-hoc / one-off crons that
# never opted into the schema.  See
# docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-30-agent-iteration-marker-fallback.md.

    the brief (verified live: the brief never landed, the reply had no context).
    So we CREATE the flat session row first, exactly like
    ``_seed_cron_thread_session`` does for threads, then mirror into it.

    The session KEY must match what the user's later inbound reply resolves to
    (``build_session_key``):
    - **Channel** (``chat_type="group"``): key is
      ``…:group:<chat_id>:<user_id>`` — user-isolated — so the seed MUST carry
      the **origin's real ``user_id``** (the member who scheduled the job), NOT
      a synthetic ``system:cron`` id, or the reply keys to a different session.
    - **1:1 DM** (``chat_type="dm"``): the key is ``…:dm:<chat_id>`` and does
      NOT embed ``user_id``, so any ``user_id`` resolves to the same session.
    ``chat_type`` mirrors the inbound handler's own choice
    (``"dm" if is_dm else "group"``, ``adapter.py``), so the seeded key is
    byte-identical to the reply's key.

    Returns True if a seed row was created and the brief mirrored, else False
    (caller falls back to the plain mirror). Best-effort — a delivery that
    already succeeded is never failed by a seeding problem.

    Plugs the #3968 gap: ``_scan_cron_prompt`` runs on the user-supplied
    prompt at create/update, but skill content is loaded from disk at
    runtime and was never scanned. Since cron runs non-interactively
    (auto-approves tool calls), a malicious skill carrying an injection
    payload bypassed every gate.

    Two pattern tiers, selected by what the assembled prompt CONTAINS,
    not just whether skills are attached:

    - When the assembled prompt is essentially the user prompt + the cron
      hint (no skills, no injected data), the STRICT ``_scan_cron_prompt``
      patterns apply: a bare ``rm -rf /`` in a small directive prompt is a
      smoking gun, not prose.
    - When the assembled prompt includes runtime-loaded content — skill
      markdown (``has_skills=True``) or DATA injected from a job script's
      stdout / an upstream job's output (``has_injected_data=True``) — the
      LOOSER ``_scan_cron_skill_assembled`` pattern set is used: only
      unambiguous prompt-injection directives block; command-shape
      patterns are dropped and invisible unicode is sanitized (stripped +
      logged) rather than blocked, to avoid false-positives that
      permanently kill a job. Skill bodies are vetted at install time by
      ``skills_guard.py``; script output is produced by operator-authored
      code, the same trust class — and data feeds (e.g. a triage bot
      ingesting bug reports) legitimately quote dangerous commands.

    When the looser tier is selected because of injected data only,
    ``user_prompt`` (the raw, pre-assembly prompt) is additionally scanned
    with the STRICT set so the user-authored surface keeps the full
    create/update-time guarantee at runtime (defense-in-depth for legacy
    jobs that predate the create-time scanner).
