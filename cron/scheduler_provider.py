"""CronScheduler provider interface (Axis B — the trigger).

⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL — this interface is validated by exactly ONE consumer (the
built-in) until an external provider (Chronos, Phase 4) shakes it out. Until
then the module path, method signatures, and start() kwargs MAY change without
a deprecation cycle. Once a second provider validates the shape it becomes
stable. Any growth MUST be additive (new optional method with a default), never
a changed signature on start() or a new abstractmethod.

A CronScheduler decides *when* a due job fires. It does NOT decide what firing
means: execution + delivery stay in cron.scheduler.run_job / _deliver_result,
shared by all providers. Providers must never reimplement agent construction or
delivery.

The built-in InProcessCronScheduler runs the historical 60s daemon-thread
ticker. Alternative providers (e.g. Chronos, a NAS-mediated managed-cron
provider for scale-to-zero deployments) live under plugins/cron_providers/<name>/ and are
selected via the `cron.provider` config key (empty = built-in).

        process that dies mid-run -- a force-killed gateway, a ``hermes cron
        run`` whose terminal closed -- leaves the row ``ended_at NULL``.
        Nothing else closed it: the execution ledger got its ``unknown`` verdict
        and jobs.json its stamp at the next scheduler start, but the session
        row read RUNNING until ``hermes-postgres-bridge.py``'s 24h idle reaper
        stamped it ``reaped_stale`` (measured 2026-09-06/07: a 12:00 run whose
        gateway was replaced at 12:10 stayed open until 12:15 the next day).

        WHY "no non-terminal ledger row for the job" IS PROOF OF ORPHANHOOD.
        Every run claims its execution row BEFORE ``run_job`` creates the
        session (``create_execution`` precedes dispatch on both the builtin
        path, ``_submit_with_guard``, and the direct path, ``run_one_job``),
        and the row stays ``claimed``/``running`` until the run's own teardown
        -- which ends the session first. So while any process is inside a run
        of job J, the ledger holds a non-terminal row for J. This runs AFTER
        :func:`recover_interrupted_execution_records` has flipped every
        dead-owner row to ``unknown``; what is still non-terminal is owned by a
        live process, an unprovable one, or this very process, and every such
        job is left alone -- a live run elsewhere (e.g. the desktop ticker or a
        CLI run) keeps its session open. The check is per JOB rather than per
        session, so in the rare case where a job has both an orphan and a live
        run, the orphan waits for the next pass rather than risk the live one.

        Only ids of the ``cron_<job>_<stamp>`` shape are touched, only rows with
        ``source='cron'``, and only through :meth:`SessionDB.end_session`, which
        is first-reason-wins and no-ops on an already-ended row. Never raises:
        this sits on the ticker's startup path, where an exception would cost
        the gateway its scheduler (the 2026-08-11 outage); a failure here only
        costs the rows their prompt close.
