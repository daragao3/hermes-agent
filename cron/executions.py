    """Return a non-terminal execution of ``job_id`` in ANOTHER process whose
    owner is PROVABLY alive.

    ``None`` means "no proof of a live run elsewhere", which deliberately lumps
    together "the owner is dead" and "liveness could not be determined". A
    caller gating admission must treat only a non-None result as grounds to
    refuse: refusing on an unprovable probe would leave the job unfireable with
    no recovery path, reintroducing the exact wedge the fire-claim TTL exists
    to prevent.

    That is the opposite of :func:`_owner_is_live`'s fail-safe-to-True, and the
    asymmetry is intentional. On the recovery path "assume still owned" is
    cheap and self-correcting — the next restart re-probes. As an admission
    gate it is neither.

    **Rows owned by THIS process are excluded, and that exclusion is load
    bearing.** Their pid is alive by definition, so a stale one — a row whose
    ``finish_execution`` never landed, e.g. an abandoned soft-deadline run —
    would read as a live run forever. Nothing cleans it either:
    :func:`recover_interrupted_execution_records` skips rows whose
    ``process_id`` is ``_PROCESS_ID``, precisely because it cannot distinguish
    them from its own in-flight work. In a long-lived gateway that combination
    would wedge the job permanently. The in-process case is already owned by
    ``cron.scheduler``'s ``_in_flight`` registry (Guard #3), which is exact
    rather than inferred, so this function answers the strictly cross-process
    question and the two compose without overlap.

    Rows are probed newest-first and the scan stops at the first live owner, so
    the blocking case normally costs exactly one probe. The sqlite read is
    finished (and both locks released) before any probing begins, so a slow
    ``psutil`` call never holds the ledger lock.
