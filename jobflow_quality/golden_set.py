"""Build a labelled evaluation set from evidence the scorer did not produce.

The premium-routing plan gates every route change on a golden set. The tempting
source is the pipeline's own history, and it is mostly poison: of 5,189 rows,
4,670 are archived — archived *because the scorer scored them low*. Grading the
scorer against its own past verdicts yields near-perfect agreement and says
nothing at all about quality. That circularity is the failure this module
exists to prevent, and it is not hypothetical: an auto-route approval and a
human approval land in the same stage, with the same shape, distinguishable
only by an actor buried in a history entry.

Two label sources survive the test "would this still be true if the scorer were
wrong?":

**Human decisions.** A person moved the job through the approval gate
(``actor_id: diego`` via ``tracker-intent-applier``, on an ``APPROVAL_INTENT``).
All three are required together: a bare actor name is not evidence, because
until 2026-09-03 the Control Center defaulted it to ``diego`` for requests that
established nobody. These are the *nuanced* cases — the ones a scorer can
plausibly get wrong — so they carry the weight.

**Posting facts.** A stated compensation ceiling below the bail line decides the
job whatever any model thinks. These are *obvious*, and are labelled as such
because an evaluation set padded with easy negatives flatters every scorer that
reads it.

Difficulty is therefore recorded per item, and :func:`summarize` refuses to call
a set balanced when one difficulty dominates.

Items carry no posting text — only a SHA-256 reference — so the set can be
committed while the postings stay where they are.
