"""The release gate: does a candidate route earn the right to run in production?

The premium-routing plan's gate reads *"No premium route is changed until
workload evaluation and shadow outputs pass. Cost is a tie-breaker only after
quality floors."* This is that gate, and it fails closed. Four ways to not
pass, and only two of them are "the candidate was wrong":

* **The set cannot judge.** An evaluation set that is all easy negatives scores
  any competent candidate near-perfectly. A headline accuracy computed over it
  is not evidence, so an unbalanced set never passes regardless of the score.
* **The candidate did not answer.** A missing prediction is scored as wrong,
  never skipped. Treating silence as agreement is how a candidate that crashed
  on half the set walks through the gate with 100%.
* **The candidate did no better than a coin.** Accuracy is floored *per
  difficulty*, never in aggregate, because the aggregate is exactly where a
  failing half hides. A candidate that predicts one label for every item is
  refused outright whatever it scores: that is a constant, not a scorer, and on
  a set whose halves are single-label it collects one perfect half for free.
* **The candidate excluded a human-approved job.** See below.

The errors are not symmetric and the gate refuses to average them. Advancing a
job that should have been excluded costs one model call — reported, not fatal.
Excluding a job a person approved destroys a real opportunity and leaves no
artifact to notice it happened. Precision on those items is therefore required
to be perfect: one false exclude fails the gate outright, whatever the
aggregate accuracy says.

# DELIBERATELY THE CHANCE LINE AND NOT A QUALITY BAR, for the same reason the
# protected-positive rule is stated as a rule: a floor picked for taste is a
# floor someone tunes down later, and this one has to survive that. It is the
# weakest threshold that does the job it was added for.
#
# MEASURED, not hypothesised. Baseline #1 (2026-09-04) was the first evaluation
# ever run against the golden set, and it found this gate reachable by a
# candidate that had made no decision at all: a constant "always advance"
# predictor scored 50% over the 56-item set, produced zero false excludes, and
# returned passed=True with an empty reason list. The same run showed why the
# floor cannot be an aggregate one — the production Matcher scored 100% on the
# nuanced half and 28.6% on the obvious half, which averages to a 64.3% headline
# that reads like a mediocre scorer rather than one that never learned to
# exclude.
