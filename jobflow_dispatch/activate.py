"""Turning a scanned activation into a woken worker, in code.

The reconciler used to hand its scan output to an LLM and instruct it, in
prose, to resolve each activity to exactly one ENABLED cron job and trigger it
with ``hermes cron run``. That command re-enables whatever it triggers, so the
only thing standing between a mis-resolving agent and a revived worker was a
sentence in a prompt. This module is that sentence, as code.

``resolve_job_id_for_activity`` lives here rather than in the event subscriber
because it now has two consumers — the dispatcher and the reconciler — and the
dispatcher's own docstring already requires that routing, the claim ledger, and
the availability predicate each have exactly one implementation. Resolution
belongs in that set.

#: Activities whose LIVE cron lane is chosen by a runtime marker rather than by
#: which alias happens to be enabled. Maps activity ID -> the cron NAME that is
#: the live lane WHILE the Phase-B cutover marker exists; when the marker is
#: absent the activity falls back to its normal ``policies.yaml`` aliases.
#:
#: The matcher needs this because the two lanes cannot be told apart by
#: enablement alone: the promoted graph lane (``jobflow-matcher-shadow``) runs
#: its own ``15 */2`` schedule and is enabled in BOTH cutover states, while the
#: mailbox lane (``jobflow-matcher``) is paused at cutover and resumed on
#: rollback. So "the one enabled matcher job" is ambiguous exactly when it
#: matters. The cutover marker is the single source of truth for which lane is
#: live — ``bin/matcher_shadow_run.py`` keys its own SCORE_RESULT write-target
#: on the same file — so reconcile follows it, and a rollback (delete the marker
#: and ``hermes cron resume jobflow-matcher``) re-points reconcile back to the
#: mailbox lane with no code change. The override is deliberately kept here and
#: NOT added to the policy aliases: ``cron/scheduler.py`` resolves a job's
#: policy from its name via that alias map, so listing the graph lane there
#: would silently rebind its budgets/models to the matcher policy.
