# Hermes Agent - Development Guide

Instructions for AI coding assistants and developers working on the hermes-agent codebase.
This root file holds only what applies everywhere. Each area has its own `AGENTS.md` (aim for
~8k chars; `agent/subdirectory_hints.py` delivers up to 32k and truncates head/tail with a warning
past that); see the **routing table** at the end and read the area file before editing in that area.

**Never give up on the right solution.**

## What Hermes Is

Hermes is a personal AI agent that runs the same agent core across a CLI, a messaging
gateway (Telegram, Discord, Slack, ~20 platforms), a TUI, and an Electron desktop app. It
learns across sessions (memory + skills), delegates to subagents, runs scheduled jobs, and
drives a real terminal and browser. It is extended primarily through **plugins and skills**,
not by growing the core.

Two invariants shape almost every design decision and are the lens for reviewing any change:

- **Per-conversation prompt caching is sacred.** A long-lived conversation reuses a cached
  prefix every turn. Anything that mutates past context, swaps toolsets, reloads memories, or
  rebuilds the system prompt mid-conversation invalidates that cache and multiplies the user's
  cost. We do not do it; the ONE exception is context compression. Slash commands that mutate
  system-prompt state (skills, tools, memory) must be **cache-aware**: default to deferred
  invalidation (takes effect next session) with an opt-in `--now` flag (`/skills install --now`
  is the canonical pattern).
- **The core is a narrow waist; capability lives at the edges.** Every model tool is sent on
  every API call, so the bar for a new *core* tool is high. New capability should arrive as a
  CLI command + skill, a service-gated tool, or a plugin — not as core surface.

## Contribution Rubric — What We Want / What We Don't

The project's intent layer. It serves humans aiming a contribution AND the automated triage
sweeper, which may only close on `implemented_on_main`, `cannot_reproduce`, or `incoherent`.
Taste-based "out of scope" closes are a human maintainer's call; the sweeper's job is to
recognize design intent and *avoid wrongly closing a legitimate contribution*.

Read the balance right: Hermes ships a **lot**. Most merges are bug fixes to reported
behavior, and the product surface (platforms, providers, models, desktop/TUI features)
expands aggressively on purpose. The restraint below targets the **core agent + model tool
schema**, the one place where every addition is paid for on every API call. "Smallest
footprint" governs *how a capability is wired into the core*, not whether the product may
grow: expansive at the edges, conservative at the waist.

### What we want

- **Fix real bugs, well.** Reproduce the symptom on current `main`, point to the exact line
  where it manifests, and fix the whole bug class — sibling call paths included.
- **Expand reach at the edges.** New adapters, channels, providers, models, desktop/TUI/
  dashboard features land routinely, including large ones — as long as they integrate with
  the existing setup/config UX (`hermes tools`, `hermes setup`, auto-install) rather than
  bolting on a raw env var.
- **Refactor god-files into clean modules.** Huge mechanical `+N/-N` extraction PRs are
  wanted work. "Every line traces to the request" applies to *feature* PRs; a declared
  refactor's request IS the extraction.
- **Keep the core narrow.** Prefer, in order: extend existing code → CLI command + skill →
  service-gated tool (`check_fn`) → plugin → MCP server in the catalog → new core tool (last
  resort). See the Footprint Ladder.
- **Extend, don't duplicate.** Check whether existing infrastructure covers the use case
  before adding a module/manager/hook. When 3+ open PRs integrate the same *category*
  (memory backends, providers, notifiers), design an ABC + orchestrator, wrap the existing
  built-in as the first provider, and turn the competing PRs into plugins against it.
- **Behavior contracts over snapshots.** Tests assert how two pieces of data relate, never
  freeze a current value (see Testing).
- **E2E validation, not just green unit mocks.** Anything touching resolution chains, config
  propagation, security boundaries, remote backends, or file/network I/O must exercise the
  real path with real imports against a temp `HERMES_HOME`. Mocks hide integration bugs.
- **Cache-, alternation-, and invariant-safe.** Preserve prompt caching, strict role
  alternation (never two same-role messages in a row; never a synthetic user message injected
  mid-loop), and a system prompt byte-stable for the life of a conversation.
- **Contributor credit preserved.** Salvage external work by cherry-picking (rebase-merge) so
  authorship survives; build on top rather than reimplementing.

### What we don't want (rejected even when well-built)

- **Speculative infrastructure.** Hooks/callbacks/extension points with no concrete consumer.
  Adding a hook is easy; removing one after plugins depend on it is hard. A hook with a real,
  stated use case is NOT speculative even if the consumer ships separately.
- **New `HERMES_*` env vars for non-secret config.** `.env` is for secrets only. Behavioral
  settings (timeouts, thresholds, flags, display prefs) go in `config.yaml`; bridge to an
  internal env var in code if the mechanism needs one. Reject "set X in your .env" docs
  unless X is a credential.
- **A new core tool when terminal + file (or a skill) already do the job.** If the only
  barrier is file visibility on a remote backend, fix the mount, not the toolset.
- **Lazy-reading escape hatches on instructional tools.** No `offset`/`limit` pagination on
  tools that load content the agent must read fully (skills, prompts, playbooks) — models
  read page 1 and skip the rest.
- **"Fixes" that destroy the feature they secure.** Read the original intent
  (`git log -p -S`) before restricting behavior; find a fix that preserves the feature.
- **Outbound telemetry / usage attribution without opt-in gating.** No analytics,
  third-party identifier tagging, or attribution tags until a generic user-facing opt-in
  (config gate + setup prompt + `hermes tools` toggle) exists. Park behind a label.
- **Change-detector tests, cache-breaking mid-conversation, dead code wired in without E2E
  proof, plugins that touch core files.** Plugins work within the ABCs/hooks we provide; if
  one needs more, widen the generic plugin surface, never special-case it in core.
- **Third-party products integrated into the core tree.** Observability backends, vendor
  SaaS connectors, analytics dashboards, and other "someone else's product" plugins do NOT
  land under `plugins/` — every one becomes our burden against a fast-moving core for a
  backend we don't own. Ship as a **standalone plugin repo** (`~/.hermes/plugins/` or pip
  entry point), promoted in the Nous Research Discord `#plugins-skills-and-skins`. This is a
  coupling decision, not a quality bar; such PRs are closed with a pointer to publish.

### Before you call it a bug — verify the premise (and when NOT to close)

The most common reason a well-written PR is closed is a **wrong premise** or treating an
**intentional design as a gap**. These patterns tell a reviewer what to scrutinize and tell
the sweeper when a PR is NOT safe to close (when in doubt, leave it open for a human):

- **"Intentional design, not a gap."** Ask whether the isolation IS the design. Profiles are
  independent islands on purpose: a PR adding live config inheritance from the default
  profile was closed because coupling profiles is exactly what the design prevents (`--clone`
  already covers "start from my default"). Read `git log -p -S "<symbol>"` before assuming
  something is unfinished.
- **"The premise doesn't hold against how X actually works."** Trace the real runtime before
  accepting a rationale. Real closes: a rate-limit "re-probe during cooldown" PR (the breaker
  trips only on a *confirmed-empty* bucket, so re-probing hammers a bucket proven empty); a
  usage fix whose new branch **never executes** because an earlier guard already popped the
  state. If you can't point to the exact line where the bug manifests AND show the fix changes
  that line's behavior, the premise is unverified.
- **"The absence was deliberate."** Restoring "missing" `__init__.py` files made a test tree
  importable as a dotted package that shadowed the real plugin and deleted its `register()`
  at import time. The omission was load-bearing.
- **"Overreached / resurrected an approach we moved past."** Scope creep beyond the agreed
  base, or reviving a direction maintainers closed, is rejected even when it works. Offer the
  rest as a focused follow-up.

Throughline: **verify the claim AND the intent against the codebase before writing or merging
a fix.** A reproduction on current `main` plus a line-level account beats a plausible
rationale. When unsure about intent, asking is cheaper than shipping a fix that fights the
design.

### The Footprint Ladder (new capability decision)

Choose the highest (least-footprint) rung that correctly solves the problem:

1. **Extend existing code** — a variation of something that exists. Zero new surface.
2. **CLI command + skill** — config/state/infra expressible as shell commands; the agent runs
   `hermes <subcommand>` guided by a skill. Default for subscriptions, scheduled tasks,
   service setup (`hermes webhook`, `hermes cron`, `hermes tools`).
3. **Service-gated tool (`check_fn`)** — needs structured params/returns AND only appears when
   a prerequisite is configured (Home Assistant tools, memory-provider tools).
4. **Plugin** — third-party/niche/user-specific; lives in `~/.hermes/plugins/` or a pip
   package, discovered at runtime.
5. **MCP server (in the catalog)** — genuinely a tool but not core-fundamental. Zero permanent
   core-schema footprint, reusable by any MCP host, reached via the built-in MCP client.
6. **New core tool** — only when fundamental, broadly useful to nearly every user, and
   unreachable via terminal + file or an MCP server (terminal, read_file, web_search,
   browser_navigate).

### Surface capability is a property of the SESSION, never of the process env

A tool that works only because of *who is on the other end* (desktop panes, in-app browser,
message reactions, Projects) must resolve availability from the **session's own source**, not
from an env var on the backend. Client and backend are separate machines: the desktop app may
drive a locally spawned backend, one over SSH, one behind URL + token, or Hermes Cloud, and
only the first two carry `HERMES_DESKTOP=1`. An env-keyed gate is a silent no-op on the other
topologies — the tool is stripped from the schema while the platform hint tells the model it
is "inside the Hermes desktop app". The pattern:

- **The toolset is the surface gate.** Keep such tools off `_HERMES_CORE_TOOLS` and in a named
  toolset (`desktop_ui`, `project`); the GUI gateway's `_load_enabled_toolsets(platform)`
  folds it in when the session's platform says GUI. One resolver, every topology.
- **`check_fn` answers reachability or opt-in, not surface.** "Is the bridge wired?" — fine.
  "Was I spawned by Electron?" — not. `check_fn` results are TTL-cached process-wide
  (`tools/registry.py`); a per-session answer does not belong there.
- **Ask which identity you mean.** `HERMES_DESKTOP=1` legitimately means "this backend was
  spawned by the app" (cron ticker, web-dist handling). It does NOT mean "a GUI is watching";
  the embedded terminal pane (`hermes --tui` against that backend) is the counterexample.

Test: if the capability still makes sense with the client on another machine, it is
session-scoped. Assert the GUI session gets the tool **with the env var absent**.

## Development Environment

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate   # or: source venv/bin/activate
```
`scripts/run_tests.sh` probes `.venv`, then `venv`, then `$HOME/.hermes/hermes-agent/venv`
(worktrees sharing the main checkout's venv).

**Logs:** `~/.hermes/logs/` — `agent.log` (INFO+), `errors.log` (WARNING+),
`gateway.log` (gateway-component records only) and `gateway-forensics.log`
(unfiltered catch-all, INFO+) when running the gateway. Profile-aware via
`get_hermes_home()`. Browse with `hermes logs [--follow] [--level ...]
[--session ...]`. Override the forensics path with `HERMES_GATEWAY_LOG_FILE`
in `~/.hermes/.env` (root, NOT profile-scoped — see `hermes_cli/env_loader.py`).

## TypeScript Style

Applies to TypeScript across Hermes: desktop, TUI, website, and future TS packages.

- Prefer small nanostores over component state when state is shared, reused, or read by distant UI.
- Let each feature own its atoms. Chat state belongs near chat, shell state near shell, shared state in `src/store`.
- Components that render from an atom should use `useStore`. Non-rendering actions should read with `$atom.get()`.
- Do not pass state through three components when the leaf can subscribe to the atom.
- Keep persistence beside the atom that owns it.
- Keep route roots thin. They compose routes and shell; they should not become controllers.
- No monolithic hooks. A hook should own one narrow job.
- Prefer colocated action modules over hidden god hooks.
- If a callback is pure side effect, use the terse void form:
  `onState={st => void setGatewayState(st)}`.
- Async UI handlers should make intent explicit:
  `onClick={() => void save()}`.
- Prefer interfaces for public props and shared object shapes. Avoid `type X = { ... }` for object props.
- Extend React primitives for props: `React.ComponentProps<'button'>`, `React.ComponentProps<typeof Dialog>`, `Omit<...>`, `Pick<...>`.
- Table-driven beats condition ladders when mapping ids, routes, or views.
- `src/app` owns routes, pages, and page-specific components.
- `src/store` owns shared atoms.
- `src/lib` owns shared pure helpers.

## AIAgent Class (run_agent.py)

The real `AIAgent.__init__` takes ~60 parameters (credentials, routing, callbacks,
session context, budget, credential pool, etc.). The signature below is the
minimum subset you'll usually touch — read `run_agent.py` for the full list.

```python
class AIAgent:
    def __init__(self,
        base_url: str = None,
        api_key: str = None,
        provider: str = None,
        api_mode: str = None,              # "chat_completions" | "codex_responses" | ...
        model: str = "",                   # empty → resolved from config/provider later
        max_iterations: int = 90,          # tool-calling iterations (shared with subagents)
        enabled_toolsets: list = None,
        disabled_toolsets: list = None,
        quiet_mode: bool = False,
        save_trajectories: bool = False,
        platform: str = None,              # "cli", "telegram", etc.
        session_id: str = None,
        skip_context_files: bool = False,
        skip_memory: bool = False,
        credential_pool=None,
        # ... plus callbacks, thread/user/chat IDs, iteration_budget, fallback_model,
        # checkpoints config, prefill_messages, service_tier, reasoning_config, etc.
    ): ...

    def chat(self, message: str) -> str:
        """Simple interface — returns final response string."""

    def run_conversation(self, user_message: str, system_message: str = None,
                         conversation_history: list = None, task_id: str = None) -> dict:
        """Full interface — returns dict with final_response + messages."""
```

### Agent Loop

The core loop is inside `run_conversation()` — entirely synchronous, with
interrupt checks, budget tracking, and a one-turn grace call:

```python
while (api_call_count < self.max_iterations and self.iteration_budget.remaining > 0) \
        or self._budget_grace_call:
    if self._interrupt_requested: break
    response = client.chat.completions.create(model=model, messages=messages, tools=tool_schemas)
    if response.tool_calls:
        for tool_call in response.tool_calls:
            result = handle_function_call(tool_call.name, tool_call.args, task_id)
            messages.append(tool_result_message(result))
        api_call_count += 1
    else:
        return response.content
```

Messages follow OpenAI format: `{"role": "system/user/assistant/tool", ...}`.
Reasoning content is stored in `assistant_msg["reasoning"]`.

---

## CLI Architecture (cli.py)

- **Rich** for banner/panels, **prompt_toolkit** for input with autocomplete
- **KawaiiSpinner** (`agent/display.py`) — animated faces during API calls, `┊` activity feed for tool results
- `load_cli_config()` in cli.py merges hardcoded defaults + user config YAML
- **Skin engine** (`hermes_cli/skin_engine.py`) — data-driven CLI theming; initialized from `display.skin` config key at startup; skins customize banner colors, spinner faces/verbs/wings, tool prefix, response box, branding text
- `process_command()` is a method on `HermesCLI` — dispatches on canonical command name resolved via `resolve_command()` from the central registry
- Skill slash commands: `agent/skill_commands.py` scans `~/.hermes/skills/`, injects as **user message** (not system prompt) to preserve prompt caching

### Slash Command Registry (`hermes_cli/commands.py`)

All slash commands are defined in a central `COMMAND_REGISTRY` list of `CommandDef` objects. Every downstream consumer derives from this registry automatically:

- **CLI** — `process_command()` resolves aliases via `resolve_command()`, dispatches on canonical name
- **Gateway** — `GATEWAY_KNOWN_COMMANDS` frozenset for hook emission, `resolve_command()` for dispatch
- **Gateway help** — `gateway_help_lines()` generates `/help` output
- **Telegram** — `telegram_bot_commands()` generates the BotCommand menu
- **Slack** — `slack_subcommand_map()` generates `/hermes` subcommand routing
- **Autocomplete** — `COMMANDS` flat dict feeds `SlashCommandCompleter`
- **CLI help** — `COMMANDS_BY_CATEGORY` dict feeds `show_help()`

### Adding a Slash Command

1. Add a `CommandDef` entry to `COMMAND_REGISTRY` in `hermes_cli/commands.py`:
```python
CommandDef("mycommand", "Description of what it does", "Session",
           aliases=("mc",), args_hint="[arg]"),
```
2. Add handler in `HermesCLI.process_command()` in `cli.py`:
```python
elif canonical == "mycommand":
    self._handle_mycommand(cmd_original)
```
3. If the command is available in the gateway, add a handler in `gateway/run.py`:
```python
if canonical == "mycommand":
    return await self._handle_mycommand(event)
```
4. For persistent settings, use `save_config_value()` in `cli.py`

**CommandDef fields:**
- `name` — canonical name without slash (e.g. `"background"`)
- `description` — human-readable description
- `category` — one of `"Session"`, `"Configuration"`, `"Tools & Skills"`, `"Info"`, `"Exit"`
- `aliases` — tuple of alternative names (e.g. `("bg",)`)
- `args_hint` — argument placeholder shown in help (e.g. `"<prompt>"`, `"[name]"`)
- `cli_only` — only available in the interactive CLI
- `gateway_only` — only available in messaging platforms
- `gateway_config_gate` — config dotpath (e.g. `"display.tool_progress_command"`); when set on a `cli_only` command, the command becomes available in the gateway if the config value is truthy. `GATEWAY_KNOWN_COMMANDS` always includes config-gated commands so the gateway can dispatch them; help/menus only show them when the gate is open.

**Adding an alias** requires only adding it to the `aliases` tuple on the existing `CommandDef`. No other file changes needed — dispatch, help text, Telegram menu, Slack mapping, and autocomplete all update automatically.

---

## TUI Architecture (ui-tui + tui_gateway)

The TUI is a full replacement for the classic (prompt_toolkit) CLI, activated via `hermes --tui` or `HERMES_TUI=1`.

### Process Model

```
hermes --tui
  └─ Node (Ink)  ──stdio JSON-RPC──  Python (tui_gateway)
       │                                  └─ AIAgent + tools + sessions
       └─ renders transcript, composer, prompts, activity
```

TypeScript owns the screen. Python owns sessions, tools, model calls, and slash command logic.

### Transport

Newline-delimited JSON-RPC over stdio. Requests from Ink, events from Python. See `tui_gateway/server.py` for the full method/event catalog.

### Key Surfaces

| Surface | Ink component | Gateway method |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Chat streaming | `app.tsx` + `messageLine.tsx` | `prompt.submit` → `message.delta/complete` |
| Tool activity | `thinking.tsx` | `tool.start/progress/complete` |
| Approvals | `prompts.tsx` | `approval.respond` ← `approval.request` |
| Clarify/sudo/secret | `prompts.tsx`, `maskedPrompt.tsx` | `clarify/sudo/secret.respond` |
| Session picker | `sessionPicker.tsx` | `session.list/resume` |
| Slash commands | Local handler + fallthrough | `slash.exec` → `_SlashWorker`, `command.dispatch` |
| Completions | `useCompletion` hook | `complete.slash`, `complete.path` |
| Theming | `theme.ts` + `branding.tsx` | `gateway.ready` with skin data |

### Slash Command Flow

1. Built-in client commands (`/help`, `/quit`, `/clear`, `/resume`, `/copy`, `/paste`, etc.) handled locally in `app.tsx`
2. Everything else → `slash.exec` (runs in persistent `_SlashWorker` subprocess) → `command.dispatch` fallback

### Dev Commands

```bash
cd ui-tui
npm install       # first time
npm run dev       # watch mode (rebuilds hermes-ink + tsx --watch)
npm start         # production
npm run build     # full build (hermes-ink + tsc)
npm run typecheck # typecheck only (tsc --noEmit)
npm run lint      # eslint
npm run fmt       # prettier
npm test          # vitest
```

### TUI in the Dashboard (`hermes dashboard` → `/chat`)

The dashboard embeds the real `hermes --tui` — **not** a rewrite.  See `hermes_cli/pty_bridge.py` + the `@app.websocket("/api/pty")` endpoint in `hermes_cli/web_server.py`.

- Browser loads `web/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx`, which mounts xterm.js's `Terminal` with the WebGL renderer, `@xterm/addon-fit` for container-driven resize, and `@xterm/addon-unicode11` for modern wide-character widths.
- `/api/pty?token=…` upgrades to a WebSocket; auth uses the same ephemeral `_SESSION_TOKEN` as REST, via query param (browsers can't set `Authorization` on WS upgrade).
- The server spawns whatever `hermes --tui` would spawn, through `ptyprocess` (POSIX PTY — WSL works, native Windows does not).
- Frames: raw PTY bytes each direction; resize via `\x1b[RESIZE:<cols>;<rows>]` intercepted on the server and applied with `TIOCSWINSZ`.

**Do not re-implement the primary chat experience in React.** The main transcript, composer/input flow (including slash-command behavior), and PTY-backed terminal belong to the embedded `hermes --tui` — anything new you add to Ink shows up in the dashboard automatically. If you find yourself rebuilding the transcript or composer for the dashboard, stop and extend Ink instead.

**Structured React UI around the TUI is allowed when it is not a second chat surface.** Sidebar widgets, inspectors, summaries, status panels, and similar supporting views (e.g. `ChatSidebar`, `ModelPickerDialog`, `ToolCall`) are fine when they complement the embedded TUI rather than replacing the transcript / composer / terminal. Keep their state independent of the PTY child's session and surface their failures non-destructively so the terminal pane keeps working unimpaired.

### Electron Desktop Chat App (`apps/desktop/`)

A **separate** chat surface from both the classic CLI and the dashboard's embedded TUI. It is an Electron + React + nanostore renderer (`@assistant-ui/react`) that talks to a `tui_gateway` backend over JSON-RPC (`requestGateway(method, params)`). The WebSocket/JSON-RPC transport lives in the framework-agnostic `apps/shared` package (`@hermes/shared` — `JsonRpcGatewayClient` + WS URL helpers), which the web dashboard (`web/`) also consumes; **desktop has no build/runtime dependency on the dashboard frontend** — it spawns a headless `hermes serve` backend server (the same gateway `dashboard` serves, minus the browser UI entirely: `serve` sets `headless_backend=True`, so `cmd_dashboard` skips `_build_web_ui` AND exports `HERMES_SERVE_HEADLESS=1` so `mount_spa()` disables the SPA even if a stray `web_dist/` exists — only the JSON-RPC/WS/API surface is reachable). `dashboard` and `serve` share `cmd_dashboard`/`start_server` but are independent surfaces — neither launches the other. The one exception is a backward-compat *fallback*: `serve` is newer, so the desktop spawn (`electron/backend-command.ts` + `backendSupportsServe()` in `electron/main.ts`) detects whether the resolved runtime registers `serve` and, only when it does not (an older managed install / PATH `hermes` the app hasn't updated yet), rewrites the argv to the legacy `dashboard --no-open`. Without that, a new app against an un-upgraded runtime would crash on an unknown subcommand and brick every mid-upgrade user. It does NOT embed `hermes --tui` — it has its own composer, transcript, and slash-command pipeline. For scoped Desktop architecture, state, resolver, transport, and testing rules, read `apps/desktop/AGENTS.md`.

**Slash commands in the desktop app are curated client-side, then dispatched to the backend.** The pipeline:

- **Backend already provides everything.** `tui_gateway/server.py` `commands.catalog` (empty-query list) and `complete.slash` (typed-query completions) both include built-in commands, user `quick_commands`, AND skill-derived commands (`scan_skill_commands()` / `get_skill_commands()`). The desktop app does not need a new RPC to see skills.
- **The renderer curates via `apps/desktop/src/lib/desktop-slash-commands.ts`.** This is the load-bearing file. It holds `DESKTOP_COMMAND_SPECS` (the built-ins and their Desktop surfaces) plus `NO_DESKTOP_SURFACE` block-lists for terminal-only / messaging-only / picker-owned / settings-owned / advanced commands that should NOT clutter the desktop popover.
  - `isDesktopSlashCommand(name)` — gates **execution**. Returns true for built-ins AND for any non-built-in (skill / quick command), so typed extension commands run.
  - `isDesktopSlashSuggestion(name)` — gates **discovery/completion**. Used by BOTH completion paths in `app/chat/composer/hooks/use-slash-completions.ts` (empty-query catalog filter + typed-query `complete.slash` filter) and by `filterDesktopCommandsCatalog`.
  - `isDesktopSlashExtensionCommand(name)` — true when the command is NOT a known Hermes built-in (i.e. a skill or user quick command). Both suggestion and catalog-filter paths allow extensions through so skill commands surface in the palette. (Added when fixing "skill commands missing from the desktop slash palette" — the curated allow-list was silently dropping every skill/quick command from completions even though they executed fine when typed.)
- **Dispatch** lives in `app/session/hooks/use-prompt-actions/slash.ts` (`runSlash`): built-ins that the desktop owns (`/skin`, `/help`, `/new`, …) are handled locally or via `commands.catalog`; everything else goes to `slash.exec`, falling back to `command.dispatch` (which the gateway resolves into skill / alias / exec directives). A skill command resolves to `{type: "skill", message}` and is submitted as a normal prompt.

**Rule:** the desktop slash palette's curation is about hiding noise (terminal-only / messaging-only built-ins), NOT about hiding user-activated extensions. Skill commands and `quick_commands` are extensions the backend surfaces — they belong in completions. If you tighten `desktop-slash-commands.ts`, keep `isDesktopSlashExtensionCommand` flowing into both the suggestion and catalog-filter paths. Tests: from `apps/desktop`, run `npx vitest run src/lib/desktop-slash-commands.test.ts` (workspace dependencies are installed at the repo root).

## Adding New Tools

Before adding any tool, settle the footprint question first (see "The
Footprint Ladder" in the Contribution Rubric): most capabilities should NOT
be core tools. For custom or local-only tools, do **not** edit Hermes core.
Use the plugin route instead: create `~/.hermes/plugins/<name>/plugin.yaml`
and `~/.hermes/plugins/<name>/__init__.py`, then register tools with
`ctx.register_tool(...)`. Plugin toolsets are discovered automatically and can be
enabled or disabled without touching `tools/` or `toolsets.py`.

Use the built-in route below only when the user is explicitly contributing a new
core Hermes tool that should ship in the base system.

Built-in/core tools require changes in **2 files**:

**1. Create `tools/your_tool.py`:**
```python
import json, os
from tools.registry import registry

def check_requirements() -> bool:
    return bool(os.getenv("EXAMPLE_API_KEY"))

def example_tool(param: str, task_id: str = None) -> str:
    return json.dumps({"success": True, "data": "..."})

registry.register(
    name="example_tool",
    toolset="example",
    schema={"name": "example_tool", "description": "...", "parameters": {...}},
    handler=lambda args, **kw: example_tool(param=args.get("param", ""), task_id=kw.get("task_id")),
    check_fn=check_requirements,
    requires_env=["EXAMPLE_API_KEY"],
)
```

**2. Add to `toolsets.py`** — either `_HERMES_CORE_TOOLS` (all platforms) or a new toolset. **This step is required:** auto-discovery imports the tool and registers its schema, but the tool is only *exposed to an agent* if its name appears in a toolset. `_HERMES_CORE_TOOLS` is not dead code — it's the default bundle every platform's base toolset inherits from.

Auto-discovery: any `tools/*.py` file with a top-level `registry.register()` call is imported automatically — no manual import list to maintain. Wiring into a toolset is still a deliberate, manual step.

The registry handles schema collection, dispatch, availability checking, and error wrapping. All handlers MUST return a JSON string.

**Path references in tool schemas**: If the schema description mentions file paths (e.g. default output directories), use `display_hermes_home()` to make them profile-aware. The schema is generated at import time, which is after `_apply_profile_override()` sets `HERMES_HOME`.

**State files**: If a tool stores persistent state (caches, logs, checkpoints), use `get_hermes_home()` for the base directory — never `Path.home() / ".hermes"`. This ensures each profile gets its own state.

**Agent-level tools** (todo, memory): intercepted by `run_agent.py` before `handle_function_call()`. See `tools/todo_tool.py` for the pattern.

---
**User state:** `~/.hermes/config.yaml` (settings), `~/.hermes/.env` (secrets only),
`~/.hermes/logs/` (`agent.log` INFO+, `errors.log` WARNING+, `gateway.log`); all
profile-aware via `get_hermes_home()`. Browse logs with `hermes logs [--follow] [--level] [--session]`.

**Dependency chain:** `tools/registry.py` (no deps) ← `tools/*.py` (register at import) ←
`model_tools.py` (discovery) ← `run_agent.py`, `cli.py`, `batch_runner.py`, `environments/`.

### Facade + siblings layout (Sep 2026 decomposition)

Every former god file is a **facade** (public entry points + the names other packages import)
plus **siblings** `<stem>_<topic>.py` in the same directory, each owning one topic. Largest
families: `hermes_state.py` (21), `gateway/run.py` (15), `tools/mcp_tool.py` (15),
`hermes_cli/kanban.py` (14), `hermes_cli/web_server.py` (13 + 24 routers), `hermes_cli/auth.py`
(12), `tools/browser_tool.py` (11), `cli.py` (12 `hermes_cli/cli_*_mixin.py`), `run_agent.py`
(`agent/turn_*.py`, `agent_init.py`, `conversation_loop.py`).

- **Find code by topic, not by facade:** `grep -rn "def name" <dir>/<stem>_*.py`. Reading the
  facade first is the expensive way (`evals/codebase_navigability/`).
- **Siblings may import each other and late-import the facade** inside functions. A facade
  never imports a sibling at module level *and* gets imported by that sibling at module level.
- **Patch where production reads.** Siblings often do `from <facade> import name` inside the
  function so `monkeypatch.setattr(facade, "name", ...)` is the seam; a patch on the defining
  module passes silently. Check the call site's binding before writing a patch target
  (blind repointing to defining modules broke 130+ tests).
- **Compat pointers are OFF LIMITS in-tree.** Old import paths kept alive for external plugins
  (`PLUGIN-COMPAT` blocks, `COMPAT_MANIFEST.md`, `compat_manifest.json`) must not be used by
  in-tree code or tests; `scripts/check_compat_pointers.py` runs in CI, and
  `-W error::hermes_cli.plugin_compat.HermesPluginCompatWarning` catches them in the suite.
  They are removed 2026-09-14 by reverting one commit. Import from the defining module.
- **Don't recreate god files.** A file passing ~2,000 lines or a function passing ~300 lines /
  cyclomatic complexity 30 is the signal to split along `<stem>_<topic>` FIRST, in its own
  commit. New behaviour goes in a new or topical sibling — never appended to a facade.
- **No `if/elif` ladders ≥ 4 branches keyed on a name/kind** — use a dict/table → handler
  (`_SLASH_DISPATCH` in `cli.py`, `_command_handler_table` in the gateway are the shape).
- **No re-export shims for internal moves** ("keep the old name importable"). Internal paths
  are not API; external compat is handled ONCE by the compat layer, not per PR.
- **Moving a symbol means fixing its docs in the same PR:** grep `website/docs`, `docs/`,
  `skills/`, and every `AGENTS.md` for the old `path.py` + symbol (23 doc files went stale
  after the refactor). `evals/codebase_navigability/static_metrics.py <tree> <label>` measures
  file/function/CC/elif distributions before/after a large PR in ~2 min.

## Code Shape Rules (all languages)

- No "defense-in-depth" wrappers, `try/except: pass` around code that cannot fail, or flags
  nobody sets. Docstrings/comments keep the WHY, cut the WHAT.
- **Never infer process identity from argv substrings** (`"serve" in cmdline`) — the bug class
  behind ~10 fleet-update issues (#90778, #87594, #78089, #76129, #91964). Use the canonical
  matchers `gateway.status.looks_like_gateway_command_line` and
  `hermes_cli.update_cmd._hermes_holder_subcommand`; flag sets are DERIVED from the parser
  (`_holder_value_flags()`), never hand-written; match FULL cmdlines and truncate only for
  display. Details: `hermes_cli/AGENTS.md`.
- **Never hardcode `~/.hermes`.** `get_hermes_home()` for code paths, `display_hermes_home()`
  for user-facing text (both from `hermes_constants`). Hardcoding breaks profiles (5 bugs in
  PR #3575). Module-level constants are fine — they cache after `_apply_profile_override()`
  sets `HERMES_HOME`. Profile operations themselves are HOME-anchored
  (`_get_profiles_root()` = `Path.home()/.hermes/profiles`) so `hermes -p x profile list`
  sees all profiles — intentional, not a bug.
- **Argparse alias dispatch:** `add_parser("list", aliases=["ls"])` sets `dest` to the literal
  the user typed (`"ls"`). Dispatch must accept both (caught PTY-testing `hermes webhook ls`).
- **Don't wire in dead code without E2E validation.** Unshipped code was dead for a reason;
  E2E the real resolution chain with real imports against a temp `HERMES_HOME` first.

### TypeScript style (desktop, TUI, website, future TS packages)

Small nanostores over component state when state is shared or read by distant UI; each
feature owns its atoms (chat near chat, shared in `src/store`); rendering components use
`useStore`, non-rendering actions read `$atom.get()`; never thread state through three
components when the leaf can subscribe; persistence sits beside the atom that owns it. Route
roots stay thin (compose routes + shell, never controllers). No monolithic hooks — one narrow
job each; colocated action modules over god hooks. Pure side-effect callbacks use the terse
void form `onState={st => void setGatewayState(st)}`; async handlers make intent explicit
`onClick={() => void save()}`. Interfaces for public props and shared object shapes (not
`type X = {...}`); extend React primitives (`React.ComponentProps<'button'>`, `Omit`, `Pick`).
Table-driven beats condition ladders for ids/routes/views. `src/app` owns routes/pages,
`src/store` shared atoms, `src/lib` pure helpers.

## Dependency Pinning Policy

All dependencies carry upper bounds (litellm compromise #2796/#2810; Mini Shai-Hulud worm,
May 2026). PyPI: `>=floor,<next_major` (`"httpx>=0.28.1,<1"`); pre-1.0: `<0.(minor+2)`
(`>=0.29,<0.32`). Git URLs: 40-char commit SHA. GitHub Actions: SHA + `# vN` comment. CI-only
pip: `==exact`. A bare `>=X.Y.Z` is rejected by CI and reviewers. Run `uv lock` after
changing `pyproject.toml`. Reference: #2810 (bounds), #9801 (SHA pinning + audit CI).

## Commits, Merges, PRs

- **Squash merges from stale branches silently revert recent fixes.** Before squash-merging,
  bring the branch to `main` (`git fetch origin main && git reset --hard origin/main`, re-apply
  the PR's commits). Verify with `git diff HEAD~1..HEAD` after merging — unexpected deletions
  are a red flag.
- Salvage by cherry-pick so contributor authorship survives (see rubric).
- Tests per fix: 1–2 INVARIANT tests (behaviour contract, proven red on base), never
  change-detectors; ≤ 2 tests is the salvage bar too. Reject/rewrite in salvaged diffs:
  appendages to facades, new god helpers, compat aliases, wrappers.

## Testing (applies everywhere)

**ALWAYS use `scripts/run_tests.sh`**, never bare `pytest`. It enforces CI parity: credential
vars unset, `TZ=UTC`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `HERMES_HOME` → temp dir, and per-file subprocess
isolation via `scripts/run_tests_parallel.py` (no xdist; workers scale with CPU count) so
module-level dicts/ContextVars cannot leak between files. Direct `pytest` on a big machine
with API keys set has caused repeated "works locally, fails in CI" incidents (and the reverse).

```bash
scripts/run_tests.sh                                    # full suite
scripts/run_tests.sh tests/gateway/                     # one directory
scripts/run_tests.sh tests/agent/test_foo.py -k test_x  # runner is file-granular; -k narrows
scripts/run_tests.sh -v --tb=long                       # pytest flags pass through
```

- **Flake policy:** a failing FILE is retried once in a fresh subprocess (`--file-retries`;
  `HERMES_TEST_FILE_RETRIES=0` disables). Pass-on-retry is green but printed under `⚠ FLAKY`
  with both outputs — a bug to fix, not noise. Timing tests must not assume a quiet runner:
  wall-clock bounds ≥ 2s, event-based sync, no `assert not _wait_until(...)` races.
- **Placement:** `scripts/ci/classify_changes.py` picks jobs by changed files. A Python test
  asserting about `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `tsconfig.json`, or `.ts/.tsx/.js/
  .mjs/.cjs` sources will not run on a JS-only PR (green on PR, red on `main` where the
  classifier fails open). Such tests belong in the vitest suite, not `tests/*.py`.
- **Tests must not write to `~/.hermes/`.** The autouse `_isolate_hermes_home` fixture in
  `tests/conftest.py` redirects `HERMES_HOME`; never hardcode `~/.hermes/` in tests. Profile
  tests also mock `Path.home()` so `_get_profiles_root()` / `_get_default_hermes_home()` stay
  in the temp dir (pattern: `tests/hermes_cli/test_profiles.py`):
  ```python
  @pytest.fixture
  def profile_env(tmp_path, monkeypatch):
      home = tmp_path / ".hermes"; home.mkdir()
      monkeypatch.setattr(Path, "home", lambda: tmp_path)
      monkeypatch.setenv("HERMES_HOME", str(home))
      return home
  ```
  Tests that `patch.object(Path, "home", ...)` must ALSO set `HERMES_HOME` — code reads the
  env var, not `Path.home()/.hermes`.

### Don't fake the host OS

Behaviour that genuinely differs per host is tested ON that host with `@pytest.mark.linux_only`
/ `macos_only` / `windows_only`, never by patching `sys.platform`. Host-independent things stay
unmarked: pure functions that take the platform as data (`hidden_windows_child_options(opts,
is_windows=True)`) and declaration/packaging invariants ("pyproject declares `tzdata` with a
`sys_platform == 'win32'` marker"). Setting a module-level `IS_WINDOWS` flag and calling
`windows_detach_flags()` IS a fake. The line: **if the test needs the interpreter to believe it
is on another OS to pass, it belongs on that OS.** A test that walks several platforms in
sequence is split — host-native arm on Linux, other arms as their own marked tests.

#### Host-saturation guards

Concurrency is bounded twice. `-j` bounds a single invocation (default:
`os.cpu_count()`). A **machine-global slot limiter** bounds every invocation on
the box together, so two concurrent runs — typically in different worktrees —
take turns instead of stacking to 2x the core count. A **commit-charge gate**
additionally holds off a spawn while memory is tight, then spawns anyway with a
warning after 120s rather than hanging.

This exists because on 2026-08-12 ~50 stacked pytest subprocesses exhausted
commit on this 12-core box and starved a Hermes dashboard boot for 29 minutes
(5.1s CPU / 3 threads / 83MB RSS after 29 min, vs 6.1s / 6 / 110MB healthy —
RSS *below* healthy means the working set never faulted in: thrashing, not a
deadlock). Measured: two `-j 12` invocations peak at 24 concurrent workers
unlimited, 12 with the limiter.

Escape hatches are **CLI flags, not env vars** — `run_tests.sh` execs under
`env -i`, so anything not in its allowlist never reaches the runner:

```bash
scripts/run_tests.sh --no-host-limit        # disable both guards
scripts/run_tests.sh --host-slots 8         # host-wide ceiling
scripts/run_tests.sh --min-free-commit-gb 0 # disable just the memory gate
```

#### Why the wrapper
**Use the marker, never a bare `skipif`.** `scripts/ci/list_os_marked_tests.py` finds files for
the macOS/Windows lanes by grepping the marker *name*, then filters with `-m <marker>`. A
`skipif(sys.platform != "win32")` test skips on Linux AND is never imported on Windows — it runs
nowhere, silently. A file-local alias (`windows_only = pytest.mark.skipif(...)`) is listed but
`-m windows_only` deselects everything: green over zero coverage. Don't `pytest.skip()` non-host
rows of a platform `@parametrize` — split into one marked test per OS.

**Live Windows process-topology E2E (`wine2e` lane):** `windows-venv-e2e.yml` runs
`tests/hermes_cli/test_venv_holder_windows_live.py` on a real `windows-latest` runner (real
processes, no mocked psutil) ONLY on pushes to `wine2e/**` branches. Workflow: write probes
pinning CORRECT behavior, push to `wine2e/` to reproduce live on unfixed code, fix, iterate to
green, then open the PR with the live receipt. Extend it when touching that subsystem; assert
against the gateway ANCESTOR found by argv, not the direct parent (the venv shim makes every
spawn a launcher/worker chain).

### Don't write change-detector tests

A change-detector fails whenever data *expected to change* is updated — model catalogs,
`_config_version`, enumeration counts, hardcoded model lists. It adds no coverage and taxes
every routine update. Don't: `assert "gemini-2.5-pro" in _PROVIDER_MODELS["gemini"]`,
`assert DEFAULT_CONFIG["_config_version"] == 21`, `assert len(models) == 8`. Do: `assert
"gemini" in _PROVIDER_MODELS and len(_PROVIDER_MODELS["gemini"]) >= 1` (plumbing works);
`assert raw["_config_version"] == DEFAULT_CONFIG["_config_version"]` (migration reaches
latest); `assert not (set(moonshot_models) & coding_plan_only_models)` (no leak); every
catalog model has a context-length entry (relationship). If it reads like a snapshot, delete
it; if it reads like a contract between two pieces of data, keep it. Reviewers reject new
change-detectors; authors convert them before re-review.

### Never read source code in tests

A test that reads a `.py`/`.ts`/`.tsx` file's text tests the *shape of the source*, not
behavior — banned outright. It passes when the implementation is subtly broken (regex matches
a mis-wired call site) and fails on correct refactors; it can't run against bundled/minified
artifacts; it blocks structural cleanup; it gives false confidence. Don't
`fs.readFileSync('main.ts')` + `assert.match(source, /spawn\(...hiddenWindowsChildOptions/)`.
Do extract the logic into a pure/DI-testable function and call it:
```ts
export function hiddenWindowsChildOptions(options = {}, isWindows = process.platform === 'win32') {
  if (!isWindows || 'windowsHide' in options) return options
  return { ...options, windowsHide: true }
}
```
If the logic lives inline in a god-file and extraction feels disruptive, that is the signal to
extract, not to regex around it.
