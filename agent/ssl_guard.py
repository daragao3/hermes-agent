# Bundles already parsed successfully in this process, keyed by file identity
# (resolved path + size + mtime). Loading a CA bundle means asking OpenSSL to
# parse ~150 PEM certificates and then decoding every one of them into a Python
# dict for the emptiness check — measured at 3.8-9.4s per call on a Windows dev
# box. That was paid on EVERY AIAgent construction, because agent_init calls
# this guard unconditionally: a test file building a handful of agents spent
# minutes here, and under the nightly gate's per-test --timeout individual
# tests were killed mid-construction.
#
# This is a preventive startup check whose answer is a property of a file, so
# re-deriving it per agent buys nothing. Keying on (path, size, mtime_ns) rather
# than caching a bare "already ran" flag keeps it honest: a different bundle, or
# the same path rewritten, is a different key and gets revalidated — which is
# what the guard's own tests rely on as they point certifi at successive
# tmp_path files. Only successes are cached; failures are rare and re-checked.
