"""Gemini usage scrape via AI Studio's own apikey-page RPCs over CDP.

Google ships no usage/quota API for Gemini API billing (v1beta/rateLimits
is 404; BatchGetProjectUsageLimits has no public surface). But the AI
Studio web app itself calls internal MakerSuiteService RPCs when you open
its "API keys" page:

  ListImportedProjects -> [["projects/<id>",1]]        (project discovery)
  BatchGetProjectUsageLimits(["projects/<id>"]) ->
      [[ [<project>, null, ["USD", null, <spent_micros>], ["USD", "<budget_dollars>"]] ]]

so we drive an existing aistudio.google.com tab there over CDP (:9222,
the automation-profile Chrome), intercept at Fetch response stage, and
read the bodies straight off the wire. No request replay, no header
capture: the app builds and sends everything itself; we only listen.
Everything degrades to None -- never raises -- so a closed browser or a
logged-out session reads as "no data", not a collector crash.
