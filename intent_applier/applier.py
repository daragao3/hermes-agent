"""IntentApplier -- orchestration of the intent flow.

For each intent file in the inbox:
  1. Parse (corrupt JSON -> dead-letter immediately)
  2. Idempotency check (already applied -> skip + move to processed)
  2b. Pre-flight state check (Fix A): if a native-Postgres reader is wired and
      the job is ALREADY IN the state the requested stage maps to, the intent
      is a
      redundant no-op — skip steps 3/3b/4 entirely (no legacy-projection write,
      no mirror, no congesting :4100 POST) and move to processed ("satisfied").
      Fails OPEN: any reader error / unknown stage falls through to the normal
      dual-write path, so the optimization can never block a real transition.
  3. Pipeline.json write via PipelineManager (canonical-first)
  3b. Mirror the intent as a PIPELINE_UPDATE message into the tracker mailbox
      inbox, so the tracker agent applies it to ITS canonical projection
      (profiles/tracker/workspace/pipeline.json) on the next cron cycle
  4. JobOps API write via JobOpsClient (Postgres mirror)
     - Transient failure (read-timeout / 5xx / socket) or breaker-open:
       leave pipeline.json done, move file to partial/, key NOT burned
     - Permanent failure: dead-letter
  5. Mark idempotent + move file to processed/
  6. Optionally call resume_full if metadata.thread_id is present

Pipeline.json is canonical: if step 3 succeeds, the operation is logically
successful. Step 4 failures are recorded in a partial queue for later
reconciliation but do not block subsequent intents.

The idempotency key represents "the Postgres mirror committed" and is burned
ONLY on a confirmed 2xx from ``post_legacy_stage`` (step 5). A transient /
breaker-open failure moves the intent to partial/ WITHOUT burning the key, so
it stays re-drivable — burning it there diverges the ledger from Postgres and
makes a later legitimate (job, stage) transition silently skipped_idempotent
(latent bug observed 2026-07-13, job 4de4f9fb :withdrawn).

# Fix A — the business state that makes a requested legacy stage a redundant
# no-op. EXACT TARGET MATCH ONLY: an intent is redundant when the job is already
# IN the state the stage maps to, and in no other case.
#
# This used to be an "at or past" set per stage, on the theory that a job
# downstream of the request had already satisfied it. That theory assumes intents
# only ever move a job FORWARD. They do not. The operator release review ->
# approved runs BACKWARD along BUSINESS_STATE_ORDER (approved_for_tailor ranks 2,
# materials_ready ranks 3) and is the single highest-volume operator action there
# is -- it is how a tailored job is sent back to be re-tailored. Listing
# materials_ready as satisfying 'approved' classified that deliberate action as a
# redundant replay and threw it away. This is the same direction error that
# 5cf02a1a6 fixed one layer down in hermes-postgres-bridge.py; the ordered list
# is a pipeline order, not a legality order, and "past" is not a safe proxy for
# "already done".
#
# There is no cost to the narrowing. Suppressing less can only ever cost one POST
# to :4100 -- which is all this pre-flight was ever protecting -- while
# suppressing wrongly destroys an operator decision with no event, no error, and
# no way to retry (the idempotency key is burned on the way out). In production
# the pre-flight has fired 15 times in total and every one was a false positive.
#
# Stages NOT listed here (e.g. 'scored', 'applied', 'final_submission') are
# deliberately omitted — the pre-flight will NOT short-circuit them and they flow
# through the normal gated dual-write path.

        PipelineManager writes the legacy ``workspaces/tracker/pipeline.json``

        ``profiles/tracker/workspace/pipeline.json`` — which only the tracker
        LLM maintains, by ingesting PIPELINE_UPDATE messages from its inbox.
        Without this mirror, dashboard/Telegram stage changes never reach the
        canonical store and postgres-sync reverts their Postgres side within
        15 minutes.

        The intent inbox and the tracker mailbox inbox are the same directory;
        ``scan_inbox`` only consumes ``*_INTENT_*.json``, and this filename
        must never contain ``_INTENT_`` (Windows globbing is case-insensitive,
        so even a lowercase ``_intent_`` infix would be re-consumed).

        Returns True iff the mirror is on disk. NEVER raises: a mirror failure
        must not crash the single applier thread that every other intent shares.

        CHANGED 2026-08-24 — this used to be best-effort, returning None and
        swallowing failures on the grounds that "the JobOps mirror and tracker
        parity sync remain as fallbacks". Neither is a fallback for this write.
        The JobOps mirror is the *Postgres* side, which postgres-sync then
        reverts to match canonical (see this docstring's own second paragraph),
        and parity sync reconciles toward canonical too — so both "fallbacks"
        converge on the store the lost mirror is precisely what failed to
        update. A swallowed failure here therefore destroys the decision, and
        because the caller went on to burn the idempotency key it destroyed it
        permanently. Callers now gate consumption on the return value.
