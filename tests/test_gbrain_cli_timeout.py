"""Timeout-safety tests for the gbrain CLI shell-outs.

These cover ``hermes_cli._subprocess_compat.run_text_capture`` — the helper the
honcho bridge uses for ``gbrain`` calls — with a focus on the Windows hang it
exists to prevent: ``subprocess.run(capture_output=True, timeout=N)`` does NOT
reliably time out when the spawned child spawns a *grandchild* that inherits the
capture pipe handles. The grandchild keeps the pipe's write end open, so the
reader-thread drain never reaches EOF and the caller blocks forever. The helper
captures into temp files instead, so there is no pipe to hold open and no
reader thread to drain — that, not the tree-kill, is what makes the bound hold.
The tree-kill is still done on timeout, but only to avoid leaking the process
tree, and it is synchronous, so the real bound is ``timeout`` + up to ~10s.
