"""Regression: importing ``hermes_cli.auth`` must not import ``httpx``.

Why this exists
---------------
``hermes_cli/auth.py`` is an 8,583-line credential module whose HTTP use is
entirely OAuth: device-code logins, token refreshes, discovery documents. None
of that happens at import time. But it carried ``import httpx`` at module
scope, and ``gateway.config.load_gateway_config()`` does ``from hermes_cli.auth
import has_usable_secret`` -- so every ``hermes send`` to a real platform paid
for it.

``import httpx`` is worth 256 modules on this box. httpx 0.28.1's ``__init__``
runs ``from ._main import main``, which is its CLI entry point and drags in
click, rich, pygments and attrs. A Telegram notification was loading a terminal
syntax highlighter. Measured on PRECISION 2026-08-20:

    import hermes_cli.auth            304 -> 138 modules
    hermes send --to <platform> msg   516 -> 369 modules

This is the third and last instance of one defect found in the same sweep. The
first two were ``gateway/__init__.py`` (tests/hermes_cli/test_send_import_cost.py)
and nine bundled backend plugins
(tests/hermes_cli/test_plugin_discovery_import_cost.py).

Why the fix is shaped the way it is
-----------------------------------
The original fix (61704e7397) split the 38 ``httpx`` references: runtime users
opened with ``httpx = _ensure_httpx()``, a helper that read the module GLOBAL;
annotation-only users were covered by a TYPE_CHECKING import. Upstream's
0.21.1 lineage then replaced the helper with ``hermes_cli.auth_constants._LazyHttpx``
(87e7f41c09): the module global ``httpx`` is a proxy that imports the real
module on first attribute access and forwards get/set/del to it, so call sites
use the bare global again and the helper was retired.

What stays load-bearing is that call sites read the module GLOBAL rather than
doing a plain local ``import httpx``. Eight tests in
tests/hermes_cli/test_auth_qwen_provider.py use ``patch("hermes_cli.auth.httpx")``
-- whole-attribute replacement with a MagicMock. A local import would fetch the
real httpx and sail straight past the patch, turning a mocked test into a live
network call against a token endpoint. Eight further references patch through
the attribute (``patch("hermes_cli.auth.httpx.Client")``), which the proxy
serves by forwarding to the real module.

Both patch styles are asserted below, because "the import got cheaper" is worth
nothing if it also quietly disarmed the test suite's mocking.
