"""Regression: loading a bundled backend plugin must not import an HTTP client.

Why this exists
---------------
Bundled ``kind: backend`` plugins -- the browser, web-search, image-gen,
video-gen, dashboard-auth and spotify backends under ``plugins/`` -- are loaded
EAGERLY by ``PluginManager._discover_and_load_inner``. Bundled *platform*
plugins are deferred (``_register_deferred_platform``, because their SDKs are
unavoidably huge); backends are not, because they register tools at load time.

That is fine as long as loading one is cheap. It was not. Nine of them carried
``import requests`` or ``import httpx`` at module scope, and
``discover_plugins()`` is called by ``gateway.config.load_gateway_config()``,
which every ``hermes send`` to a real platform calls. So a Telegram message
paid for the HTTP stacks of a cloud browser, an OAuth dashboard and a Spotify
client. Measured on PRECISION 2026-08-19:

    discover_plugins() imported 362 modules; `send --to <platform>` cost 590

``import httpx`` is worth 256 modules by itself on this box: httpx 0.28.1's
``__init__`` does ``from ._main import main``, which drags in click, rich,
pygments and attrs.

The fix is per-plugin, not a change to the plugin manager: each of the nine
imports its client inside the methods that call it, and exposes the module
attribute lazily through a PEP 562 ``__getattr__`` so callers -- and the ~91
tests that patch ``"plugins.<x>.requests.post"`` -- resolve exactly the object
they always did. After: 238 modules and 516.

BEWARE THE ATTRIBUTION TRAP when re-measuring. Counting ``sys.modules`` growth
across one plugin's load charges every shared module to whichever plugin loaded
first. It named ``dashboard_auth/nous`` and ``browser/browser_use`` as the two
costs worth 291 of 359 modules; fixing exactly those two moved the identical
cost onto ``dashboard_auth/self_hosted`` and ``browser/browserbase`` and saved
nothing. Import each candidate ALONE in a fresh interpreter instead.

The AST scan below is the durable half: it fails for a NEW backend plugin that
re-introduces a module-scope client import, which no measurement of today's
tree can do.

Sequel: ``hermes_cli/auth.py`` carried the same defect and was fixed the next
day (tests/hermes_cli/test_auth_import_cost.py). That is what let the discovery
guard at the bottom tighten from requests-only to every HTTP client, and what
retired the spotify tripwire.
