"""Shared stubs that keep ``hermes_cli.doctor.run_doctor`` off slow host probes.

Every test module that calls ``run_doctor`` pays for the same three real
subprocesses, none of which any of those tests assert on. Measured on Windows
they cost ~31s of a ~39s ``run_doctor`` call:

  * ``install_doctor.probe``            ~16.6s
  * ``gh auth status --json ...``       ~10.7s
  * ``agent-browser --version``          ~3.9s

That put every ``run_doctor`` test over the repo's 30s ``--timeout`` cap from
``pyproject.toml`` (``addopts = "-m 'not integration' --timeout=30
--timeout-method=thread"``), so those files could only pass under an explicit
command-line ``--timeout=600`` -- i.e. they were silently red in a default
run, and because ``--timeout-method=thread`` kills the interpreter, the first
one to blow took the rest of the file with it.

The probes are host state rather than behaviour under test, so removing them
makes the tests deterministic as well as fast.

Usage -- in a module that calls ``run_doctor``::

    from tests.hermes_cli.conftest_doctor_externals import stub_doctor_externals

    @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
    def _stub_doctor_externals(monkeypatch):
        stub_doctor_externals(monkeypatch)

Importing this module matters as much as using the fixture, because of the
warm-up imports below.

Deliberate duplication: ``tests/hermes_cli/test_doctor.py`` carries its own
copy of these stubs (``b59c1d852`` + ``dca0d179a``) rather than importing this
module. Consolidating the two was tried and reverted -- an interleaved A/B of
the whole file, both trees under identical load, had the refactored version
blow the 30s cap while the original passed 83/83. That file has several tests
sitting at 13-17s against the cap, so it has no headroom to spend on churn.
Keep the two copies in sync by hand; if you change one, change the other.

# Warm-up imports. Do not delete: these are load-bearing, not conveniences.
#
# ``run_doctor`` imports about three dozen modules lazily (function-local
# ``import`` statements -- ``ast`` them out of ``hermes_cli/doctor.py`` if you
# want the list). Two of them dominate, and both are session-shared costs that
# a lazy import bills entirely to whichever test happens to reach them first:
#
#   * ``model_tools``       -- its module body runs ``discover_builtin_tools()``,
#                              the whole builtin tool registry. ~66s cold on
#                              Windows, ~13s warm. Also pulls in
#                              ``tools.browser_tool``, which ``run_doctor``
#                              imports separately for its Chromium check and
#                              which is ~13s on its own.
#   * ``hermes_cli.gateway`` -- reached via ``_check_gateway_service_linger``.
#                              Measured at ~50s on a loaded box.
#
# Either one alone is enough to push the first ``run_doctor`` test past the 30s
# cap. Importing them here moves the cost into collection, which pytest-timeout
# does not cover, so no single test is billed for it.
#
# ``tests/hermes_cli/test_doctor.py`` already imports both at module scope for
# exactly this reason; this block is what gives the sibling modules the same
# protection. Note that stubbing ``model_tools`` into ``sys.modules`` (as those
# siblings do per-test) does NOT substitute for the real import -- the stub
# suppresses the call, but only for tests that install it, and it does nothing
# for ``tools.browser_tool`` or ``hermes_cli.gateway``.

    the largest slice of the ~60s each ``run_doctor`` test used to take. It
    also makes the result depend on whatever happens to be installed in the
    developer's venv, so the doctor section it feeds was never deterministic.
