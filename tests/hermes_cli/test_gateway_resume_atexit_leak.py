"""A test process must not leave a gateway-resume atexit hook armed.

`_cmd_update_impl` registers `_resume_windows_gateways_after_update` with
`atexit` as a safety net, so an update that dies partway still restores the
gateway it paused. Correct in production; hazardous in a test process.

`atexit` hooks fire at INTERPRETER SHUTDOWN -- after pytest has torn every
`monkeypatch` down and restored the real `gateway_windows._spawn_detached`. A
test that exercises the update path therefore arms a hook that, at shutdown,
cold-starts a REAL detached gateway on the live box.

Observed 2026-08-18: a `pytest tests/hermes_cli/` run printed
"Starting Windows gateway after update (PID 43828)" AFTER its own summary line.
43828 was real -- gateway-exit-diag.log recorded its spawn with
`site='update:windows-cold-start'` and a parent_chain naming that pytest
process. It lost the double-run race 7s later and the watchdog spawned a
replacement: the test suite restarted production.

The guard is the autouse `_unarm_gateway_resume_atexit_hook` fixture in
conftest.py. This module tests the mechanism end to end in a SUBPROCESS,
because `atexit` exposes no public way to ask "is this armed?" -- and
`atexit._ncallbacks()` is not usable as a probe: it does not decrement on
`unregister`, though `unregister` itself works correctly.
