"""M3 hermes gateway restart helpers — lockfile cleanup + detached launch.

Spec: profiles/sentinel/workspace/gateway-restart-cluster-2026-04-30.md.

The gateway restart subcommand's manual-restart fallback path (no
systemd / launchd) was holding the operator's terminal in foreground
and not cleaning up surviving lockfiles between stop and start. M3 adds
two helpers to fix both: cleanup_gateway_state_files removes the
orphaned PID + lock files for the current profile, and
launch_gateway_detached spawns ``hermes gateway run`` in a way that
survives the parent shell closing (CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP +
DETACHED_PROCESS on Windows, start_new_session on POSIX).

These are unit tests for both helpers in isolation. The end-to-end
restart-subcommand path is covered by the existing manual_gateway_*
fixtures elsewhere; the helpers here are the new additions.
