# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Git-spawn budget.
#
# ``TestCodeDrift`` builds a real git repo per test, and on Windows every
# ``git`` spawn costs ~0.5s (``git init`` ~1.2s). At 16 spawns per test that
# put 11 of the 12 tests at 22-43s against the repo's 30s ``--timeout`` cap
# from pyproject -- and because ``--timeout-method=thread`` kills the
# interpreter, the first one over took the other 17 tests in the file with it.
# Measured with the cap lifted (``--timeout=600``): 23 passed in 402s, worst
# test 42.85s.
#
# The helpers below keep the same repo shapes and the same assertions, and only
# stop paying for spawns that produce information we can read off disk, or that
# can be paid once for the whole module instead of once per test:
#
#   * repo creation  4 spawns -> 0   (copy a once-built template)
#   * ``_commit``    3 spawns -> 2   (read HEAD instead of ``rev-parse``)
#                      -> 1 after the first (``commit -a``, no separate add)
#   * the whole per-test setup -> 0   (``_shape`` builds each distinct repo
#                                      shape once at import; tests copy it)
#
# The probe under test (``sample_code_drift``, 5 spawns) is untouched -- that
# is the behaviour these tests exist to cover, and it is now essentially all
# that is left inside the timed window.
#
# The last step matters specifically because the cap is PER TEST. Building the
# shapes at import does not reduce total work much -- it moves it into
# collection, which pytest-timeout does not cover -- but that is exactly the
# budget that was being blown. Per-test setup had to reach ~0 for the tests to
# survive `run_tests_parallel -j 8`, where every spawn costs several seconds.
