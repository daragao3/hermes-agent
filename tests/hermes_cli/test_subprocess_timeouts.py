# child on timeout, then (on Windows) re-enters ``communicate()`` with NO
# timeout to drain the capture pipes.  That drain blocks until the pipe reaches
# EOF, which cannot happen while a grandchild still holds the write handle it
# inherited — so the call lasts as long as the GRANDCHILD does, not ``N``.
# Measured on a Windows host 2026-08-15: ``subprocess.run(["cmd","/c","start /b
# ping -n 25 127.0.0.1"], capture_output=True, timeout=2)`` returned in 24.3s.
#
# ``run_text_capture`` captures into temp files — no pipe, no reader thread,
# nothing to drain — and tree-kills on timeout.  The two tests below cover the
# two shapes that hang the stdlib, and both use a child that outlives the
# budget by ~2 minutes so a regression fails on wall clock, not on luck.
