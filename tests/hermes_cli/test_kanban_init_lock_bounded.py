"""Tests for the bounded kanban init lock (issue #36644).

`connect()` wrapped its entire body in an unbounded blocking `flock(LOCK_EX)`
on every call. A single process stalled inside the critical section blocked the
long-lived gateway dispatcher's next-tick `connect()` forever — no timeout, no
recovery, board silently stops being worked.

Two fixes, both covered here:
1. Fast path: once a path is initialized in this process, `connect()` skips the
   cross-process init lock entirely (nothing left to serialize), so a held lock
   cannot block a steady-state connect.
2. Bounded acquire: even on first-init, `_cross_process_init_lock` retries a
   non-blocking acquire up to a deadline, then proceeds (with a WARNING) rather
   than hanging.
