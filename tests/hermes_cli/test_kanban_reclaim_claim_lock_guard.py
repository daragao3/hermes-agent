"""Tests: reclaim paths are claim-lock-aware so they can't desync a re-claimed
task (issue #36910).

A stale crash/stale-claim/max-runtime reclaim, computed from a snapshot of an
OLD worker, used to reset ``tasks.status`` back to ``ready`` with only a
``WHERE status='running'`` guard. If the task had since been reclaimed AND
re-claimed by a NEW worker (new run, new claim_lock, live pid), that stale
UPDATE clobbered the live task: ``tasks.status='ready'`` while the new
``task_runs.status='running'`` and the worker kept executing — the board showed
the task in the Ready lane and the dispatcher could treat live work as
available. The reset is now gated on the snapshot's ``claim_lock`` (and pid),
so it only fires when the task is still owned by the worker the reclaim was
computed for.

# These tests need two real OS processes: one that has already exited (to stand
# in for a crashed worker's pid) and one that stays alive (for the worker that
# still owns the claim). They used to spawn the POSIX binaries ``true`` and
# ``sleep``, which on Windows resolve only when Git/MSYS's ``usr/bin`` happens to
# be on PATH. Any earlier test in the same process that narrowed or blanked PATH
# therefore turned these into ``FileNotFoundError: [WinError 2]`` -- a pollution
# artifact that says nothing about the reclaim logic under test. Spawning the
# running interpreter needs no PATH lookup, so the outcome no longer depends on
# what ran before.
