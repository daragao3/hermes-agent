"""Cross-test isolation for hermes_logging's module-global file handlers.

``hermes_logging`` keeps its rotating file handlers in a module-global list
(``_queued_file_handlers``) that a background ``QueueListener`` dispatches to.
A test that points ``HERMES_HOME`` at its own ``tmp_path`` (every test does —
see the autouse ``_hermetic_environment`` fixture) and triggers
``setup_logging()`` registers handlers rooted in that tempdir.  With
``tmp_path_retention_policy = "failed"`` (pyproject.toml) pytest deletes that
directory as soon as the test passes, but the handler stays registered in the
global — so the next test in the same process that emits a record makes the
listener thread write into a directory that no longer exists::

    --- Logging error ---
    concurrent_log_handler ... FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or
    directory: '...\\pytest-NNN\\test_xxx0\\hermes_test\\logs\\.__errors.lock'

The spew is written from the listener thread, so it is attributed to no test
and fails nothing — it just corrupts the output of whatever ran afterwards.

The autouse ``_reset_queued_handlers()`` teardown in ``tests/conftest.py`` is
what prevents this.  The two tests below must run in file order: the first
registers a handler under its own HERMES_HOME, the second asserts that nothing
survived into a fresh test.
