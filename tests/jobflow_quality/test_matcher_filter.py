"""Deterministic exclusions ahead of the premium seven-dimension ranker.

The matcher is the fleet's most expensive activity. Every job it scores costs a
premium model call, and a share of them are disqualified on facts already
printed in the posting. Deciding those without a model is the cheapest saving
available.

The asymmetry drives every design choice here: a job wrongly kept costs one
model call, a job wrongly excluded costs Diego a real opportunity and does so
silently. So this filter only ever excludes on evidence PRESENT in the posting.
Absent data is never grounds for exclusion, and no judgement call — domain fit,
seniority nuance, location desirability — belongs here. Those are what the
ranker is for.
