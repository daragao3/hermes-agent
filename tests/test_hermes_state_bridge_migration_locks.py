"""Regression tests: ``SessionDB()`` open must not fail with "database is locked".

Root cause of the 2026-08-07 "all desktop sessions disappeared" incident:
every ``SessionDB()`` open runs ``_init_schema`` -> the four bridge data
migrations, each of which issued ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` (a WAL *write* lock)
*before* checking whether the migration was already applied.  On a
fully-migrated database that write lock is pure waste; under transient write
contention from the session-bridge writer it raised
``sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked`` -- 500ing the desktop's
read-only ``get_session_messages`` / session-list endpoints, which rendered an
empty session list even though every row was intact on disk.

Two guarantees:
  A. An already-applied bridge migration is a lock-free no-op (read pre-check
     before ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE``).
  B. A fresh open survives a write lock held longer than the single-shot
     SQLite busy timeout (bounded retry with jitter on the schema-ensure step).
