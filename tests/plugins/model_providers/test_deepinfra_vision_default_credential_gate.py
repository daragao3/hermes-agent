"""DeepInfra's vision-default discovery must see Hermes-managed credentials.

Regression for the 2026-08-25 restore: `default_vision_model()` gated on
`os.environ.get("DEEPINFRA_API_KEY")`, but Hermes keeps credentials in
`~/.hermes/.env` and in the auth pool and loads NEITHER into the process
environment. A correctly-installed key therefore produced None here, the
vision chain logged "deepinfra catalog unreachable or returned no
vision-tagged models -- skipping", and vision stayed dead while blaming the
network.

The gate must ask the same resolver that builds the client.

# Preference-ordered selection (2026-08-25)
#
# Discovery used to return the FIRST vision-tagged chat model in the catalog.
# DeepInfra serves that catalog in its own popularity/recency ranking, so the
# choice was a moving target: a reorder upstream silently repointed every
# Hermes vision call, and nothing logged which model had been picked. The
# incumbent first-slot model was also a reasoning model -- ~8x the price,
# 19-35s instead of 1.5-2.7s, and an empty answer (finish_reason "length",
# no error) at a tight max_tokens.
#
# Selection is now preference-ordered with catalog order as the fallback, and
# the chosen model is logged once.
#
# These tests INJECT a sentinel preference tuple rather than naming the live
# model, so they exercise the mechanism and survive a routing change. The
# actual roster is asserted in exactly one place
# (test_preference_roster_pins_the_expected_vision_model) -- this same file's
# neighbours were rewritten three times in three commits for being coupled to
# the live provider roster.
