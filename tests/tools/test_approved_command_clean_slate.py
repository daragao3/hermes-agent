"""Regression tests: a user-approved command runs from a clean interrupt slate.

Bug (manual approvals, the default): a user approves a scanner-flagged command,
then hits Stop / sends a message.  `agent.interrupt()` sets the per-thread
interrupt bit on the execution thread *during* the blocking approval-wait; the
deny that follows is a no-op once the approval was granted, so the bit persists.
Nothing cleared it between approval-grant and `env.execute`, so
`_wait_for_process` SIGINT-killed the just-approved command on its first poll and
returned exit 130 + "[Command interrupted]" while still carrying the
"...approved by the user." note (the 3-part signature).

Fix: clear the current thread's interrupt bit once before the approved command
spawns its child (terminal foreground; execute_code local + remote), and enrich
the note on a genuine post-start interrupt instead of implying success.

Invariant preserved: a genuine interrupt arriving AFTER execution starts (or
during a retry backoff) must still SIGINT the command (exit 130); non-approved
commands keep current interrupt behavior.
