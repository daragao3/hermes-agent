"""Timeout-safety tests for the local-STT shell-out in ``tools.transcription_tools``.

``_transcribe_local_command`` runs a whisper CLI under a 300s budget. Whisper
shells out to ffmpeg, so the STT command spawns a *grandchild* that inherits the
capture handles — and with a user-supplied ``HERMES_LOCAL_STT_COMMAND`` template
it runs under ``shell=True``, where the grandchild is guaranteed rather than
merely likely (cmd.exe is then the direct child). Under
``subprocess.run(capture_output=True, timeout=N)`` that grandchild holds the
pipe's write end open so the drain never reaches EOF and the timeout cannot fire
on Windows. The site therefore uses the file-backed
``_subprocess_compat.run_text_capture`` instead.

The helper has no ``check=`` and never raises ``CalledProcessError``, so the site
calls ``CompletedProcess.check_returncode()`` explicitly. These tests pin that:
losing it would silently turn a failed transcription into a "no .txt produced"
error that hides the command's own stderr.
