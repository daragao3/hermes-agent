"""Regression test for the client-side MCP discovery hang (observed 2026-07-10).

A Mission Control dashboard lost its ``mempalace`` MCP connection at 02:59
under GIL pressure and never recovered on its own, sitting tool-less for ~6
hours until a human restart. The mempalace server (:7482) was provably healthy
throughout — synthetic fresh handshakes returned all 25 tools in single-digit
ms. The bug was entirely client-side.

Sequence: the reconnect budget churned ("unhandled errors in a TaskGroup"),
then one attempt got *past* the handshake — ``Received session ID ... Negotiated
protocol version`` — but the server->client GET (SSE) stream dropped immediately
("GET stream disconnected, reconnecting in 1000ms") and then went silent.

Root cause: ``session.initialize()`` is bounded by ``connect_timeout`` (the
#59349 fix), but the *next* call — ``_discover_tools()`` → ``list_tools()`` —
was not. On a half-open transport the discovery response never arrives, so the
call awaits forever. ``run()`` wedges *inside* the transport context managers:
it never returns and never raises, so the reconnect/park state machine — and
its periodic self-probe — is never reached. The server stays parked-less and
tool-less for the life of the process.

The fix bounds tool discovery the same way the handshake is bounded, so a
stalled ``list_tools`` fails instead of hanging. That failure unwinds the
transport and re-enters ``run()``'s reconnect loop, which eventually parks with
a self-probe and self-heals once event-loop pressure clears.

This test drives the *real* ``_run_stdio`` with a fake transport whose
``initialize()`` succeeds but whose ``list_tools()`` hangs, and asserts the
connect is bounded by ``connect_timeout`` rather than blocking forever. It is
fully hermetic — no real subprocess, no network.
