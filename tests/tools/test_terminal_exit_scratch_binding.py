"""The sandbox orphan sweep must be bound to the home it was registered under.

``cli.py::_run_cleanup`` is registered with ``atexit`` and calls
``cleanup_all_environments()`` unconditionally (via the ``_cleanup_all_terminals``
passthrough at cli.py:945). That function resolves the scratch root *when it
runs* — and an atexit hook runs at interpreter shutdown, after pytest's
``monkeypatch`` teardown has restored the real ``HERMES_HOME``.

This is the mirror of the import-time snapshot bug: resolving inside the
function is the prescribed fix for "too early", and it is exactly what makes
this case "too late". The generalized rule is to resolve at the moment the
value's meaning is fixed and then CARRY it; for a deferred writer that moment
is REGISTRATION.

Two things make the leak worse than stray directories:

  * ``get_sandbox_dir()`` (tools/environments/base.py) calls
    ``p.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)``, so merely *resolving* the path
    writes. A pytest process creates ``<real home>/sandboxes/singularity/``
    on the way out even when it never sandboxed anything.
  * the sweep then ``shutil.rmtree``s every ``hermes-*`` entry under that
    root, with no owner-liveness check — unlike the browser reaper, which
    checks ``owner_pid``. ``singularity.py:189`` puts a live
    ``hermes-overlays`` directory there, so an exiting test process can
    delete a *running* process's overlays.
