"""jobflow's on-disk paths: same location in production, isolated under pytest.

Before 2026-08-17 these were MODULE-LEVEL constants built from ``Path.home()``:

    CHECKPOINT_DB = Path.home() / ".hermes" / "graphs" / "checkpoints.db"
    APPROVAL_LOG  = Path.home() / ".hermes" / "graphs" / "approval-log.jsonl"
    APPLY_LOG     = Path.home() / ".hermes" / "graphs" / "apply-log.jsonl"
    TRACKER_LOG   = Path.home() / ".hermes" / "graphs" / "tracker-log.jsonl"

Two independent defects in that shape:

1. ``Path.home()`` BYPASSES the ``HERMES_HOME`` redirect ``conftest.py`` installs,
   so anything reaching these writes lands in the developer's real
   ``~/.hermes/graphs`` — which holds live job-application records.
2. Module-level means resolved at IMPORT time, and conftest's autouse fixture sets
   ``HERMES_HOME`` AFTER import. So even the correct resolver would have snapshotted
   the wrong root if it stayed a constant. Both halves have to change together.

The resolver is ``get_default_hermes_root()`` and NOT ``get_hermes_home()``: these
files live at the ROOT (``~/.hermes/graphs``), while ``get_hermes_home()`` returns
``<root>/profiles/<name>`` under a profile-scoped HERMES_HOME. Using it would have
relocated live data into the profile dir. Same root-vs-profile rule the notification
layer follows.
