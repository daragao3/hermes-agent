"""Verify scripts/run_tests_parallel.py kills test-spawned grandchildren.

Setup
-----
A test in this file spawns a long-lived Python grandchild that writes
its PID + a nonce to a tempfile, then exits without cleaning up.
With the old ``subprocess.run`` runner, that grandchild would orphan
and outlive the test (and the whole runner). With the current Popen +
``start_new_session`` + ``_kill_tree`` runner, the grandchild gets
SIGKILL'd via process-group kill when its file's pytest exits.

The leaker test always passes — its only job is to spawn a grandchild
and walk away. The verifier runs the runner over the leaker file in a
subprocess, then waits for the grandchild PID to disappear from the
kernel's process table.

POSIX-only: Windows has its own grandchild lifecycle (no shared session,
``taskkill /F /T`` semantics). Marked accordingly.

# ── Child deadlines ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Spawns in this file come in two depths, and they need differently sized
# bounds. Both kinds are safety nets against a *wedged* child, not assertions
# about how fast it is — no bound below is asserted on — so both are sized
# generously and scaled by ``HERMES_TEST_TIMEOUT_SCALE``. See
# ``tests/timeout_budget.py`` for the rationale, and note the one rule that
# governs all of them: a deadline that IS the assertion (the 2.0s poll-round
# sleep, the ``elapsed <`` bounds in the host-saturation tests) stays small
# and unscaled, because scaling it would weaken the claim.
#
# Two generations — ``spawns_runner``
# -----------------------------------
# We launch ``scripts/run_tests_parallel.py``, which launches one
# ``python -m pytest`` worker per probe file. Idle that costs a few seconds;
# under memory/CPU pressure on a loaded box, several times that.
#
# ``_FILE_TIMEOUT`` is the runner's own per-file deadline for the nested
# pytest. It stays well below ``_RUNNER_TIMEOUT`` so a wedged *file* is
# reported by the runner (which is the behaviour under test) instead of the
# whole runner being killed out from under it.
#
# The three bounds are deliberately ordered
# ``_FILE_TIMEOUT < _RUNNER_TIMEOUT < _TEST_TIMEOUT`` so a stall is reported
# by the innermost layer that can explain it, and the pytest-level cap never
# fires first (a pytest-timeout kill takes the summary line with it).
# ``_TEST_TIMEOUT`` overrides the global ``--timeout=30`` from pyproject.toml,
# which cannot bound a nested pytest run.

# One generation — ``spawns_child``
# ---------------------------------
# The host-saturation guards below spawn a bare ``python -c`` probe (or a
# waiter thread), not the runner, so they get a much smaller cap than
# ``spawns_runner``. Their cost is dominated by interpreter start plus the
# ``scripts.run_tests_parallel`` import, which is cheap idle and slow under
# commit pressure — i.e. exactly the condition these tests exist to prevent,
# so they must tolerate it rather than fail on it.
#
# The same ordering rule applies: every inner bound fits inside
# ``_CHILD_TEST_TIMEOUT``, and ``_CHILD_TEST_TIMEOUT`` exceeds the global
# ``--timeout=30``. Without the mark, that global cap fires first and a
# thread-method kill takes the summary line with it — leaving no record of
# which test died.

    Every probe below lives under ``tmp_path`` — i.e. under the shared

    argument therefore sits OUTSIDE the rootdir pytest derives from that cwd,
    so pytest builds ``Dir`` collectors for the whole chain from the common
    ancestor down: ``C:\\Users`` → ``diego`` → ``AppData`` → ``Local`` →
    ``Temp`` → the probe dir. Collecting those directories walks the entire
    user profile.

    Two consequences, both measured on this host:

    * Collection of a two-line probe takes ~33s instead of ~0.01s — which is
      most of what the 60s child bounds used to be spent on, and why they
      tripped under load.
    * Enumerating ``%TEMP%`` races every other process that creates and
      deletes temp dirs there, so collection dies with
      ``FileNotFoundError: [WinError 2] ... 'C:\\...\\Temp\\<vanished-dir>'``
      before any test runs. Reproduced twice, naming a different vanished
      directory each time.

    Pinning ``--rootdir`` to the probe directory bounds the tree at the probe
    itself. It changes only nodeid display, which nothing here asserts on.

    * The instruction to preserve the trap predates finding a writer. One was

    * `run_tests.sh` CANNOT EXECUTE on this Windows box -- it probes POSIX
      `<venv>/bin/activate` and `HERMES_PYTHON`, neither of which exists here.
      So it was never the live reproducer locally, only a latent CI trap.
    * Decisively: the watcher this branch builds is RUNNER-AGNOSTIC. It
      watches the filesystem and catches any writer regardless of what a
      runner does to its environment. It no longer needs the bait.

    Guarding the forwarding now (rather than deleting the test) keeps the
