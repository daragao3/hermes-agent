"""The live-system guard must block real package installers in a test run.

This is the tripwire for a defect class that cost the nightly gate a whole
file. Production install call sites were converted from ``subprocess.run`` to
``hermes_cli._subprocess_compat.run_text_capture`` — correctly, because ``npm``
is ``npm.cmd`` on Windows, so the direct child is ``cmd.exe`` and the install
itself runs in a node grandchild that inherits the capture pipes, which
defeats ``subprocess.run``'s ``timeout`` outright. But the tests still patched
``subprocess.run``, so they stopped intercepting anything and reached a REAL
``npm install``. Some merely failed an assertion; in
``tests/gateway/test_whatsapp_connect.py`` the run wedged in
``run_text_capture -> proc.wait -> WaitForSingleObject`` until pytest-timeout
killed the process — which the gate reads as "no tests ran".

Re-pointing the mocks fixes today's instance. These tests are what stops the
next one: the guard sits at ``subprocess.Popen``, *below* whichever helper a
call site happens to use, so a future conversion cannot silently reintroduce
this. A mock that stops intercepting now fails loudly and instantly instead of
quietly shelling out to the network.

# Same hazard as ``curl … | sh``, but invisible to _is_remote_installer_pipe
# for two independent reasons, both real:
#
#   1. ``irm`` (Invoke-RestMethod) was simply absent from _REMOTE_FETCH_HEADS,
#      which listed only curl/wget/iwr/invoke-webrequest.
#   2. Even with it listed, the detector requires the fetch verb to HEAD a
#      pipeline segment. In ``powershell -Command "irm … | iex"`` the whole
#      pipeline lives inside one argv token, so splitting on "|" leaves
#      ``powershell`` heading segment 0 and ``irm`` never heads anything.
#
# This is not hypothetical. On 2026-08-16, writing the RED test for the
# cua-driver capture-pipe fix, a stub pointed at a not-yet-called seam let
# `hermes_cli/tools_config.py`'s real
# ``powershell -Command "irm …/install.ps1 | iex"`` execute against the
# network and hang the session. The guard sat right underneath and said
# nothing.
#
# Every URL below uses a `.invalid` host (RFC 2606 — guaranteed not to
# resolve), so if the guard ever stops firing these tests fail fast instead of
# fetching and executing a remote script the way the incident did.
