"""Self-test for the live-system guard fixture in tests/conftest.py.

This file is the canary. If anyone removes a guard or weakens it, these
tests fail. If anyone adds a NEW kill primitive to the codebase without
adding it to the guard, the corresponding test added here will fail too.

The guard exists to protect the developer's live ``hermes-gateway`` process
from being SIGTERMed by tests. See PR #23397 for the original incident
(5+ live gateway kills in 3 days). Per Teknium 2026-05-10:

  > "You better do such a deep scan and scrub of the tests that this
  >  never is possible ever again for all eternity."

Every primitive that can deliver a signal to a foreign process or mutate
the live systemd unit MUST be exercised below. Adding a new primitive to
the guard? Add a test here too.

# A guaranteed-foreign PID: one that is owned by the system, is never in
# this test's subtree, and — crucially — ACTUALLY EXISTS on the platform

#
# PID 1 (init) satisfies that on POSIX only. On Windows there is no PID 1:
# ``psutil.Process(1)`` raises NoSuchProcess, and ``_is_own_subtree`` then
# deliberately allowlists it ("stale PID — kill would be a no-op anyway").
# So on Windows a PID-1 assertion was vacuous: the guard never fired, the
# real ``os.kill`` ran, and the test failed with OSError rather than the
# RuntimeError it was written to demand — it could not fail for its own
# reason. PID 4 is Windows "System": always present, parented by PID 0,
# never in the test subtree. Same platform split — and the same reason —
# as the ``_FOREIGN_LIVE_PID`` constant added by cd51467573 (branch
# claude/zealous-mendeleev-5e8346) for the psutil-kill self-tests; if that
# branch lands, the two should collapse into this one.

# fail-OPEN: in any collection context where this file is present but its home
# conftest is not, the primitives fire for real and ``os.kill(-1, SIGTERM)``
# SIGTERMs every process the invoking user owns (a full desktop-session kill was
# reported in the field — see issue #68311). Such contexts are not exotic:
# published sdists that ship ``tests/`` but not ``tests/conftest.py``, trees
# assembled by copying ``test*.py`` files (that glob does NOT match
# ``conftest.py``), ``pytest --noconftest``, or running from a foreign rootdir.
#
# The fixture below makes the canary fail-CLOSED instead: it refuses to run any
# test in this file unless the guard is provably active, so no collection
# context can ever detonate the primitives. The one thing the canary can detect
# about its own safety is that the guard monkeypatches ``os.kill`` with a plain

# guard is about latency against localhost, this one is about an unmarked test
# calling the PUBLIC INTERNET: detect_zai_endpoint POSTs a real completion to
# every z.ai endpoint it knows, and exchange_copilot_token GETs
# api.github.com/copilot_internal/v2/token. A connect trace over
# tests/hermes_cli/test_api_key_providers.py on 2026-08-17 recorded 19 outbound
# TLS connections to 128.14.14.140/141, 122.10.144.213, 156.59.101.94 and
# 140.82.113.6 before this guard existed.
#
# A silently-uninstalled guard here does not merely slow the suite down: it
# leaks the fact of the run to two third parties and, with a real key in the
# environment, spends the developer's quota. Hence a canary.
