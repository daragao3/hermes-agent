"""The EventBus shutdown drain — best-effort delivery of teardown-time events.

``gateway/run.py`` emits GATEWAY_STOPPED early in ``_stop_impl_body`` and calls
``events.gateway_integration.shutdown()`` late in ``main()``'s teardown.
Between those points, delivery depends on the poll loop happening to tick
before the bus closes. ``shutdown()`` therefore drains subscribers itself,
after the poll threads are joined (so nothing polls concurrently) and before
the bus is closed. What that buys is a RECORD — chiefly AuditLogger writing the
shutdown event into audit.jsonl.

⚠ **The drain is not what makes the cron shutdown-attribution correct, though
bc07363000's commit message says so.** That commit reasoned the drain would
stop ``CronStaleMonitor`` missing GATEWAY_STOPPED on a 60s poll. Measured
2026-08-17, the premise fails: PID 10168 was force-killed INSIDE
``_drain_active_agents`` (logged ``notify_active_sessions done at +1.76s``,
never ``drain done``), so ``shutdown()`` never ran and two genuinely-killed
crons went unreported. Generally, whatever cuts a teardown short — the shutdown
watchdog's ``os._exit(1)`` past ``agent.restart_drain_timeout + 60s``, or the
stopper's tree kill past ``_windows_stop_drain_timeout()`` (a sub-second
TerminateProcess walk since 51ef1feed3; the 30s ``_TASKKILL_TIMEOUT_S`` it
replaced was a ``taskkill`` subprocess timeout, never a grace period) — fires
while a drain is still waiting on live work, so any hook at or after the drain
is reachable only when the drain ended EARLY — i.e. only when nothing was
killed and there is nothing to report.

Attribution therefore lives in the SUCCESSOR: ``CronStaleMonitor.startup()``
rebuilds it by QUERYING the bus, where every input is already durable
(517cc56c97). Verified in production 2026-08-17 18:41:15Z, when a fresh boot
backfilled three runs from two earlier shutdowns — including one from 04:08:21Z,
14.5 hours stale — and correctly skipped the run that had completed during
teardown.

So the tests below split by concern: the drain's own mechanics (ordering,
deadline, exclusions, error tolerance), then the two attribution paths and the
fact that they compose to exactly one record rather than two.
