"""End-to-end replay of the REAL 2026-08-14 disk episode.

Producer -> bus -> TelegramNotifier, driven by the actual C:-free readings and
inter-sample gaps recorded in ``~/.hermes/events/event_bus.db`` that morning
(03:50:27Z -> 11:08:52Z, 27 samples): the disk fell 13.57 GB -> 0.0 GB and then
sat at ~zero for seven hours.

What that episode delivered under the pre-band code, measured from the bus: an
undifferentiated message roughly once an hour, saying nothing at 0.0 GB that it
had not already said at 13 GB -- because ``normalize_for_fingerprint`` collapses
digit runs, so every one of those samples shared a single fingerprint.

Both tests pin the notifier's RepeatGuard window to 0 so the guard can never
suppress anything. Whatever these tests observe is therefore attributable to
the producer's ``change`` stamp alone -- otherwise the guard's own 30-min
collapse would make them pass for the wrong reason.
