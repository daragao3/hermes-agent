    Coverage is now guaranteed by construction (EventType requires a non-empty

    *distinguishable* — so the table can be 100% covered and still unreadable.
    The standard the EventType docstring states is per-topic, not global ("pick
    a glyph disjoint from its neighbours in the same Telegram topic"), because
    an operator only ever scans one topic's feed at a time; two identical
    glyphs in different topics never appear side by side and are deliberately
    allowed.

    and ``agent_loop_fault`` (2026-05-29), i.e. two failure events landing in
    watchdog_alerts that a reader could not tell apart at a glance. It had
    gone unnoticed for ~2.5 months. The near-miss cost was higher: efc77632f
    added 12 DevFlow icons colliding with six pre-existing types (four of them
    on a shared topic) and no test objected — it was caught only by a human
    AST diff while resolving it against a competing fix (b0adeb34c).

    Cross-topic duplicates are intentionally NOT asserted here; as of this
    writing ✅ (application_submitted / critic_auto_applied) and 🟢
    (devflow.build_succeeded / gateway_started) are both fine.
