"""Keep the curator's agent cards honest about which bus events they produce.

``~/.hermes/profiles/curator/workspace/heartbeat_bootstrap.py`` holds ``AGENTS``,
one card per JobFlow agent, and each card's ``emits`` list is rendered verbatim
into that agent's HEARTBEAT.md (``:609``). The card text describes behaviour that
lives in THIS repo — the mirror set in ``events/producers/mailbox_watcher.py`` and
the ``_translate`` chain in ``events/subscribers/mailbox_translator.py`` — and
nothing links the two. An edit here silently invalidates prose there.

It has happened twice, both times in the same direction (agent-src moved, the
card did not):

* ``a4e6ade172`` made ``SUBMIT_RESULT`` the producer of ``application_submitted``
  and deleted the ``SUBMIT_REQUEST`` branch, which handed ``application_ready``
  to ``DRY_RUN_COMPLETE``. The applier card kept crediting ``SUBMIT_CONFIRM``.
* A 2026-08-19 audit of all eleven cards then found the same omission in four
  more (scout, sentinel, tracker, notifier) plus a stale ``telegram_topic``.

That is the same drift class ``EventType``'s own docstring records for the
``EVENT_TYPE_EMOJI`` dict — four occurrences before it was made unrepresentable.
This one cannot be made unrepresentable: the cards are prose in another repo. So
it stays a check, in the spirit of that docstring's note about the routing table.

WHY THE TEST LIVES HERE AND NOT IN ``~/.hermes``
------------------------------------------------
Both incidents began with an agent-src commit. A check on the ~/.hermes side —
a pre-commit hook, or that repo's own suite — only fires when someone edits the
card, which is the moment the card is already being corrected. Failing in the
suite the translator's author is running is the whole point.

WHAT IS CHECKED
---------------
``emits``. The cards already carry latent structure: UPPERCASE tokens are
mailbox message types, lowercase tokens are bus event names. Against that:

1. COMPLETENESS — a message type a card claims to emit, which the translator
   maps, must have its event name(s) written in that card.
2. NO PHANTOM — an event name written in a card must be producible from a
   message that card claims, or be a known non-mailbox producer.

``telegram_topic``. Truth is ``AGENT_TOPIC_MAP`` in ``events/routing_policy.py``
— imported, not AST-walked, because it is a plain dict literal rather than the
if/elif chain that forced the walk above. The rule is CONTAINMENT, not equality,
and the difference is the whole design:

    AGENT_TOPIC_MAP governs ``EventType.AGENT_ITERATION`` ALONE. It is read in
    one ``elif`` at ``routing_policy.py:493-495``; it is not the topic for an
    agent's domain events.

So a card's ``telegram_topic`` string legitimately carries two things at once —
the agent-iteration topic from the map, PLUS per-event domain routes. Two cards
do exactly that today and are correct: the applier's adds "application_blocked
is ACT-tier and routes to action_required", the notifier's adds "digest_generated
is TRACE-tier and routes to scribe_daily". An equality assertion would fail both.
Containment catches the defect that actually happened (curator reading "(n/a)"
while the map carries an explicit entry) without touching them. It deliberately
does NOT police the extra routes: their truth is the per-EventType spec table,
a different invariant.

``listens``. Truth is ``ROUTES`` in ``jobflow_dispatch/contracts.py``:
the ``(message type, destination) -> activity IDs`` table that decides which
agent a mailbox write actually activates. Four destinations appear there
(matcher, tailor, applier, researcher — the last has no card), so the rule is
small, and it runs ONE WAY ONLY: every route into an agent must be named in that
agent's ``listens``; a ``listens`` entry with no route is NOT a violation.

That asymmetry is deliberate. ``listens`` describes what an agent reads, and an
agent legitimately reads mailbox messages that wake nobody — the tracker's
inbound ``PIPELINE_UPDATE`` is drained on its own cron tick, not by a wake. Only
the forward direction is a drift claim: a wake target added or renamed here
leaves the card describing an agent that no longer stirs for it.

The prose is why this is containment and not a parse. Those entries carry
observation counts ("PIPELINE_UPDATE (~1770 observed: matcher 1486...)"), which
no structured read survives; asking only whether the token appears sidesteps them
entirely.
