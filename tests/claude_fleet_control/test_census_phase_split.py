"""Phase-1 census split: one ppid snapshot, create_time only for the closure.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. On 2026-09-01 the fleet controller's pass went from a
steady 15s to past its PT4M30S ExecutionTimeLimit and was killed by Task
Scheduler (event 329) every cycle -- so fleet growth disabled the guard that
exists to contain fleet growth, and its silence watchdog was killed with it.

Cause: phase 1 asked psutil for ``ppid`` (and ``create_time``) across the
whole process table. ppid looks as cheap as pid or name and is not: psutil's
Windows backend takes a whole-system Toolhelp snapshot per call, so a
whole-table ppid census is quadratic. First-enumeration cost in a FRESH
interpreter -- the only honest comparison, since the scheduled task is always
a fresh interpreter:

    process_iter(pid)                   0.14s
    process_iter(pid, name)             0.20s
    process_iter(pid, ppid, name)      56.48s
    _psutil_windows.ppid_map()          0.06s   <- same map, one call

A first attempt at this fix blamed ``create_time`` instead, on an A/B run
INSIDE one interpreter where the create_time variant happened to run first
and absorbed the whole cold-start cost. These tests therefore pin the
mechanism explicitly (phase 1 must not ask process_iter for ppid) rather
than pinning a wall-clock number, which is exactly the measurement that
misled. Loops claim tray-329-kills-fleet-controller-20260901.
