"""Task 12 — roadmap_devflow_intake.py migrated to the shared DDP emitter.

The intake script is loaded from its REAL deployed path (via
hermes_constants.get_default_hermes_root, which the conftest does NOT patch —
only events.paths.get_default_hermes_root is), while all of its WRITES route
through the DelegationEmitter whose canonical paths resolve into the patched
tmp root. The live `.roadmap_intake_emit_enabled` sentinel that sits next to the
deployed script would otherwise flip the dry-run default on, so the `intake`
fixture neutralizes it — the test asserts behavior, not deployment state.
