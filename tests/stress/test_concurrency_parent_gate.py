"""Stress test for parent-completion invariant at the claim gate.

Simulates the create-then-link race described in RCA t_a6acd07d:

  Thread A: repeatedly inserts a child row with status='ready' (racy
            writer) and a split-second-later inserts the parent link,
            emulating the pre-fix _kanban_create path.
  Thread B: repeatedly runs claim_task against every ready task.

Pass criteria, both required:

  1. No task is ever 'claimed' while a parent link that ALREADY EXISTED
     at claim time points at a parent that had not completed. The
     claim_task gate in hermes_cli/kanban_db.py must demote such tasks
     back to 'todo' and emit 'claim_rejected' instead of spawning. The
     qualifier matters: this test deliberately links children *after*
     creating them, so a claim that precedes its own link is correct
     behaviour, not a violation, and only the event log can tell the two
     apart.
  2. The gate must have rejected at least once. A run where it never
     fired cannot have detected anything, and one such run reported
     success for exactly that reason (see the seed-parent note below).

Run as a script (`python tests/stress/test_concurrency_parent_gate.py`).
tests/stress/conftest.py sets collect_ignore_glob = ["*.py"], so pytest
never collects this file; running it directly is the only path.
