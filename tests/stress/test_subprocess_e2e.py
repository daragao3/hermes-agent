"""E2E: dispatcher spawns real Python subprocess workers.

This validates the IPC + lifecycle story that mocks can't:
  - spawn_fn returns a real PID
  - the child process resolves hermes_cli.kanban_db on its own
  - the child writes heartbeats via the CLI (real argparse, real init_db)
  - the child completes via the CLI with --summary + --metadata
  - the dispatcher observes all of this through the DB only
  - worker logs are captured to HERMES_HOME/kanban/logs/<task>.log
  - crash detection works against a real dead PID

    This has to happen before the HERMES_HOME around them is removed.
    ``_run_e2e`` decides the work is finished when every task reaches

    (``hermes kanban complete``) and has not exited at that point -- so it
    still owns ``worker_*.log`` as its stdout, and the ``complete``
    grandchild still owns ``kanban.db``. On Windows those open handles make
    the directory unremovable, and because ``cleanup_home`` cannot delete
    it, every green run leaked its whole tree.

    Measured 2026-08-17 before this wait existed: the directory only became
    deletable ~1s after the *script process itself* exited, i.e. long after
    cleanup had already run and given up. No retry inside ``cleanup_home``
    can win that race, because the holder outlives the interpreter -- the
    fix has to be to wait for the workers here.

    Incidental safety net, not the assertion (tests/timeout_budget.py rule
    2): these workers have already been observed reaching ``done``, so this
    only covers process teardown. A worker still alive at the end of the
