"""The post-turn notification drain must stay bound to the turn thread's home.

``_run_prompt_submit`` starts a daemon turn thread. After the turn's ``finally``
releases the per-turn ``HERMES_HOME`` override, the thread drains completion
notifications that arrived mid-turn and calls ``claim_event_delivery`` /
``complete_event_delivery`` / ``release_event_delivery`` — which reach
``tools.async_delegation._connect()`` -> ``_db_path()`` -> ``parent.mkdir()`` +
``sqlite3.connect()``, CREATING ``<home>/state.db``.

Why the detector never flagged it: it reports only ONE env/write pair per
candidate, and the turn thread already has one (``_sync_agent_model_with_config``
-> ``load_config``). This second late resolve was masked behind it — the exact
corollary recorded on GBrain ``concepts/import-time-hermes-home-snapshot-bug``.

WHICH home is the right one to capture is the whole design question here, and
it is NOT the same answer as the notification poller's:

  * The turn thread sets its own override from ``session["profile_home"]`` for a
    resumed remote profile — but the drain runs AFTER that override is reset, so
    today it resolves the PROCESS home, not the profile home.
  * The session's notification poller captured ``_db_path()`` under the process
    home too. ``claim_event_delivery`` is a cross-consumer claim: if the poller
    and this drain used different databases, the claim could not stop double
    delivery. They must agree.
  * ``threading.Thread`` does not propagate contextvars, so an override active
    on whichever thread called ``_run_prompt_submit`` never reaches the turn
    thread anyway.

So the capture belongs at the TOP of the turn thread, before the per-turn
override is installed — thread start, in the thread's own context, which is
exactly what the drain resolves today. Capturing at ``_run_prompt_submit``
entry (on the caller's thread) would be subtly wrong.
