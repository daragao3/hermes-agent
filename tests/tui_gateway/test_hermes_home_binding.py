"""HERMES_HOME binding for the TUI gateway's module-level home snapshot.

``tui_gateway/server.py`` resolved ``_hermes_home = get_hermes_home()`` at
module import — the original form of the bug class that
``concepts/import-time-hermes-home-snapshot-bug`` tracks, and the very constant
``_CRASH_LOG`` used to be built from.  ``tests/conftest.py``'s autouse
``_hermetic_environment`` fixture redirects ``HERMES_HOME`` to a per-test
tempdir only AFTER collection has imported this module, so the snapshot held
the developer's real ``~/.hermes`` before the first test ran.

Four of its use sites are genuine writes:

* ``_save_cfg`` -> ``atomic_config_write(<home>/config.yaml)`` — the user's LIVE
  config, reachable from every ``config.set`` branch via ``_write_config_key``;
* ``clipboard.paste`` and ``_queue_attached_image`` -> ``<home>/images/`` mkdir
  plus a PNG write;
* ``paste.collapse`` -> ``<home>/pastes/`` mkdir plus a ``.txt`` write.

Existing protection was per-test and incidental: some callers patch
``_hermes_home``, others stub ``_write_config_key``.  Nothing structural stopped
a newly added test from writing the developer's real config.yaml.

See GBrain ``concepts/import-time-hermes-home-snapshot-bug`` (original class).
