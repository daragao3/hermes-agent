"""``scripts/run_tests.sh`` must not drop the Windows OS path vars.

The wrapper does ``cd "$REPO_ROOT"`` and then

    exec env -i "${CLEAN_ENV[@]}" "$PYTHON" "$SCRIPT_DIR/run_tests_parallel.py"

``env -i`` starts from an *empty* environment, so ``CLEAN_ENV`` is an
allowlist: anything not named there is gone for the runner and — because
``run_tests_parallel.py`` hands workers ``env=os.environ`` — for every
pytest worker it spawns as well.

When ``SYSTEMDRIVE`` is missing, a Windows child cannot expand the
``REG_EXPAND_SZ`` known-folder template ``%SystemDrive%\\ProgramData`` held
in ``HKLM\\...\\ProfileList``.  The literal string is then used as a
*relative* path and the known-folder cache is built under the process CWD
— which the ``cd "$REPO_ROOT"`` above pinned to the checkout root.  The
result is a stray ``%SystemDrive%/ProgramData/Microsoft/Windows/Caches/``
tree in the repo.

Observed on 2026-08-16 18:29:34 in the shared checkout and reproduced
directly: the same ``env -i`` allowlist plus the MSIX/WindowsApps python
writes the tree; adding ``SYSTEMDRIVE=C:`` and nothing else makes it stop.

This is the wrapper-side twin of
``tests/secret_sources/test_child_env_windows_essentials.py``, which
guards the same failure mode in the secret-helper allowlists.  The test is
a static read of the script so it passes on POSIX too — what is under
test is the allowlist, not the host OS.
