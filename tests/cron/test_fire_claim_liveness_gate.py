"""The layered fire-claim admission gate (2026-08-24).

``claim_job_for_fire`` used to admit purely on claim age, so a run legitimately
longer than the 300s TTL was indistinguishable from a crashed one and a second
fire was let through. The gate adds a second, evidence-based layer:

    1. fresh claim (age < TTL)                        -> refuse
    2. stale/absent claim, but the durable execution
       ledger PROVES another run of this job is alive -> refuse
    3. otherwise                                      -> admit

Layer 1 stays load-bearing: both production call sites claim BEFORE
``create_execution``, so there is a window in which a winner holds a claim but
has not yet written its ledger row. The TTL covers exactly that window and
therefore cannot go to zero.

Layer 2 refuses only on POSITIVE proof of life. "Cannot tell" admits. That is a
deliberate inversion of ``cron/executions.py:_owner_is_live``, which fails safe
to True: on the recovery path "assume still owned" is cheap and the next restart
retries, but as an admission gate it would wedge the job forever with no
recovery path — reintroducing the exact failure the TTL exists to prevent.
Positive-proof-only is never worse than the old behaviour in any case.

Design evidence for these choices lives in
``tests/cron/test_fire_claim_ttl_vs_run_duration.py``.
