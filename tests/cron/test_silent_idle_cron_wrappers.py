"""Idle-tick stdout contract for the high-volume hybrid cron wrappers.

These jobs run every 15 minutes and their stored prompts do nothing but
reformat the script's own output and append ``[SILENT]`` on an idle tick --
i.e. the model call is a string formatter whose result is then suppressed.
A script that prints nothing on an idle tick makes ``_build_job_prompt``
return None, so the tick ends before a session, a model call, or a delivery.

Failures and real work must still reach stdout, because stdout is what gets
delivered.
