"""Regression: expanding the ``all`` routing token must not import platform SDKs.

Why this exists
---------------
``_iter_home_target_platforms`` yields the built-in platforms from
``_HOME_TARGET_ENV_VARS`` and then asks the platform registry for *plugin*
platforms that declare a ``cron_deliver_env_var``. It used to do that via
``platform_registry.plugin_entries()``, which calls ``_resolve_all()`` and runs
**every** deferred platform loader — importing the full adapter module, and with
it the whole vendor SDK, for all ~18 bundled platforms.

The only thing the loop wants from each entry is a single metadata string. The
last line of the loop already discards any entry whose name is in
``_HOME_TARGET_ENV_VARS`` — but only *after* paying for its import. Eleven of
the bundled platforms (telegram, discord, slack, matrix, whatsapp, feishu,
wecom, mattermost, sms, email, dingtalk) are exactly those built-ins, and they
are the expensive ones.

Measured on a dev box before the fix: ``deliver="all"`` expansion cost **102.0s**
of ``call`` phase and pulled 721 modules — telegram 23.8s, discord 21.8s,
hermes_cli 13.7s, aiohttp 8.4s, cryptography 7.3s. ``pyproject.toml`` sets
``--timeout=30`` with ``--timeout-method=thread``, which hard-exits the
interpreter and destroys the run's summary line, so in a monolithic run whichever
test first triggered this died and took the summary with it.

Filtering by *name* before resolving is semantically identical — the loop
already rejects those names — and skips the imports entirely.

This test runs a SUBPROCESS on purpose: ``sys.modules`` is process-global, so a
sibling test that legitimately imports ``telegram`` would mask the regression.
