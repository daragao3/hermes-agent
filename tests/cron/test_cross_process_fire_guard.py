"""Guard #5 — cross-process same-job concurrency on the TICK path (2026-08-25).

Guard #3 (``_in_flight``) is a plain dict under a ``threading.Lock``, so it is
blind to a fire running in another process. That is the gap the layered
fire-claim gate did NOT close: ``claim_job_for_fire`` is only reached by the
manual (``_execute_job_now``) and external-provider (``fire_due``) paths, while
the built-in ticker takes no fire claim at all and runs its own
``_process_job``. So the ticker could start a job that ``hermes cron run`` was
already running — the ``source='builtin'`` overlapping ``source='direct'``
shape in ``executions.db``.

Guard #5 asks the durable execution ledger, which is cross-process and
PID-recycle-safe, and refuses only on POSITIVE proof of life so it can never
leave a job permanently unfireable.

Every "a live run blocks this" case here drives a REAL second process via
``live_foreign_run``; a row opened in the pytest process would be excluded by
design (see ``live_execution_for_job``) and would prove nothing.
