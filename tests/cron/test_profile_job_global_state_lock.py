"""A cron job that switches Hermes PROFILE must hold the writer lock.

``_job_profile_context`` mutates process-global state for the whole of a
profile job's run: it sets the module-global ``_hermes_home``, installs a
Hermes-home override, and snapshots/restores ``os.environ``. While it is
active, ``_get_hermes_home()`` returns that profile's home for EVERY thread in
the process, so a concurrently-running job resolves its ``script:`` slot under
the wrong profile and dies "Script not found".

That is not hypothetical. On 2026-08-19/20 a scan of 577 cron run outputs found
8 such failures across 6 different jobs -- applier_ready_sweep,
jaum_inbox_sweep_gate, devflow_pr_build_poll, tracker_operator_drain,
phantom_root_watch, devflow_observability -- and every one resolved under
``profiles/financier`` while a financier-profile job was running
(financier-snapshot-am 0 6, financier-digest-am 5 7, financier-digest-pm 20 16).
The applier's sweep collected nothing and still reported ``last_status: ok``.

The dispatch partition in ``tick()`` already treats profile jobs as sequential
(``workdir or profile``), but the sequential pool only stops sequential jobs
overlapping EACH OTHER. What excludes the parallel-pool readers is the
readers-writer lock -- and its writer test keyed on ``workdir`` ALONE, so a
profile job took the lock as a READER and ran alongside them. The two
classifications have to agree, which is why the rule now lives in one predicate.
