"""Shared fixture for driving a REAL foreign process that holds an open
execution row.

``live_execution_for_job`` answers a strictly cross-process question — it
excludes rows owned by the calling process on purpose (a stale own-process row
would otherwise read as live forever; see its docstring). So a test that opens
a row with ``create_execution`` in the pytest process is testing nothing: that
row is excluded by design.

Every "a live run blocks this" assertion therefore needs a genuinely separate,
genuinely alive process. That is fiddly enough — and easy enough to get subtly
wrong — to be worth writing once.

Not named ``test_*`` so pytest does not collect it as a test module.

    "…and now the job is fireable again" assertion tests the guard rather than
    racing teardown.

    Two traps this exists to encapsulate:

    * ``sys.executable`` in this venv is a ~256KB **uv trampoline stub** that
      re-execs the real interpreter, so ``Popen.pid`` is NOT the process that
      runs the code (measured: 29096 vs 41112). The child reports its own
      ``os.getpid()`` through a file, and that is the pid we kill and probe.
    * ``cron.executions.EXECUTIONS_FILE`` is resolved at import time, so the
      child must assign it after import rather than rely on ``HERMES_HOME``.
