"""The autouse reset must actually clear agent.model_metadata's caches.

`agent/model_metadata.py` holds nine module-level caches behind TTLs of 3600s /
300s / 30s. Nothing cleared them between tests, so one file's metadata or
capability lookup decided the answer for every later file in the same process
— the mechanism behind the ~128 order- and timing-dependent failures in
`tests/agent`, which pass individually and fail in the hour-long run.

Verifying this needs an ordered pair, because a single test cannot observe a
fixture that runs between tests: the first poisons every cache, the second
asserts it came up clean. Written as a positive control — if the conftest block
is removed, the second test fails immediately and deterministically, rather
than the suite going quietly flaky again.
