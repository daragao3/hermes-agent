"""Wiring the rank=1 FTS integrity-check into the health paths, bounded.

``check_fts_integrity`` (schema v32) is the only probe that detects an index
rowid whose ``messages`` row is gone: ``PRAGMA integrity_check`` passes,
message writes pass, and ``search_messages`` INNER JOINs the orphan away
rather than failing on it. So it belongs in a health path.

It is also the most expensive statement either health path can run — rank=1
re-reads and re-tokenises every indexed row (12.6s on a 171 MB index; the
production state.db carries ~8x that text). ``hermes doctor`` already has a
documented hang from an unbounded scan on that database, so the rule these
tests pin is: the deep check is opt-in, and wherever it is bounded, running
out of budget must degrade to "unknown" rather than to "corrupt".

That last distinction is not cosmetic. ``conn.interrupt()`` aborts the check
with ``OperationalError: interrupted`` — a ``DatabaseError``, so the naive
handler reports it as a per-table corruption reason, and a caller wired to
``--fix`` would then rebuild a perfectly healthy index.
