"""Schema v32: ``messages_fts`` as an FTS5 external-content index over a view.

Inline FTS5 keeps a second, byte-for-byte copy of every indexed string in a
``messages_fts_content`` shadow table — 1273.9 MB of a 5120 MB production
state.db, measured 2026-08-11. External content drops that copy and re-reads
the text from ``messages`` on demand.

The subtlety these tests exist for: v11 moved this DB *away* from external
content, but only because the index had to start covering ``tool_name`` +
``tool_calls`` (#16751) while the schema pointed the FTS column straight at
``messages.content``. The ``messages_fts_source`` view supplies the 3-column
concat, so both requirements hold at once — and each test below pins one half
of that, so a future edit cannot quietly trade one for the other.

External content also changes two things that fail *silently* rather than
loudly, which the rest of the file covers:

* ``DELETE``/``UPDATE`` must hand FTS5 the OLD text through the ``'delete'``
  command so it retracts the right terms. Wrong text = a corrupt index that
  still answers queries.
* ``SELECT COUNT(*) FROM messages_fts`` counts the *view* (every message), not
  index entries — so it can no longer be used to assert that indexing happened.
