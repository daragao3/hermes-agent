# ── Child deadlines ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The process-lock tests spawn one or two fresh interpreters that import
# ``session_bridge`` and touch the filesystem. Idle that is a couple of
# seconds; under memory/CPU pressure the same spawn can take an order of
# magnitude longer, and the old 5s/10s/15s bounds tripped as
# ``subprocess.TimeoutExpired`` — a failure mode indistinguishable from a
# real lock regression, and one whose frequency tracked how many other test
# files shared the run rather than anything in the code under test.
#
# None of these bounds is asserted on: no test here claims a child is *fast*,
# only that it eventually succeeds, blocks, or raises. They are safety nets,
# so they get a generous base scaled by ``HERMES_TEST_TIMEOUT_SCALE`` (see
# ``tests/timeout_budget.py``).
#
# The one deadline that IS the assertion stays small and unscaled at its call
# site: ``skill._LOCK_WAIT_SECONDS = 0.1`` in
# ``test_process_lock_times_out_without_stealing_held_descriptor``, where the
# lock is supposed to give up. Its lock holder no longer races that budget on
# a fixed sleep — see the comment there.
