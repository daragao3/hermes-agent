"""Induced-slowness falsifier for the refresh-behind-hung-read wall-clock flake.

INDUCED SLOWNESS: the inner refresh timeout is raised to 0.5s -- well past the
OLD test's 0.1s outer budget.  This models a host so loaded that the inner
deadline lands after the outer one, which is exactly the failing condition the
flake hits under real load.  It is still comfortably inside the adapter's
release wait (raised from 2.0s to the worst-host guard on 2026-09-03, because at
2.0s that wait was a clock this test raced: it asserts the read is still hung
while the window ticks), so the read is genuinely still hung when the inner
timeout fires.

OLD shape must FAIL consistently.  NEW shape must PASS.

That expectation is ENFORCED, not merely asserted in prose.  The OLD-shape test
is marked ``xfail(strict=True)``: pytest reports it green only while it keeps
failing, and turns an unexpected PASS (XPASS) into a suite failure.  So this file
is safe to keep in the permanent run -- a plain failing test would be 5 red rows
forever, and a plain ``xfail`` would go quiet if the old shape ever started
passing, which is exactly the signal worth catching.  If it does XPASS, the
induced-slowness model has stopped reproducing the flake and the NEW-shape test
below is no longer evidence of anything.
