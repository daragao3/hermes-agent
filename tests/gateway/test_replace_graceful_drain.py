"""``--replace`` must ask the incumbent to stop, not execute it on the spot.

THE DEFECT. ``start_gateway``'s replace path wrote a takeover marker whose own
comment says it exists "so the target's shutdown handler recognises its SIGTERM
as a planned takeover", then called ``terminate_pid(pid, force=False)``. Both
halves are POSIX reasoning:

  * ``terminate_pid`` skips its ``taskkill`` branch when ``force=False`` and
    falls through to ``os.kill(pid, SIGTERM)`` -- and CPython on Windows routes
    every signal except CTRL_C_EVENT/CTRL_BREAK_EVENT through
    ``TerminateProcess``. So the "graceful" path was an unblockable kill: no
    handler, no ``atexit``, no drain. ``gateway/status.py::pid_exists`` already
    documents this hazard for ``os.kill(pid, 0)``; the SIGTERM branch was never
    reconciled with it.
  * the shutdown handler that reads the marker therefore never ran. Measured
    2026-08-24: all four replaced gateways wrote ZERO records to
    ``logs/gateway-exit-diag.log`` after their kill, against a same-log control
    of 627 ``atexit.hook`` and 42 ``gateway.exit_clean`` records.

The cost landed on cron. ``_drain_active_agents`` already waits on
``_active_cron_job_count()`` (#60432) -- the quiesce-and-drain everyone wants is
BUILT and TESTED. It simply never ran on a replace, because the incumbent was
dead before it could start draining. 39 executions across the ledger died that
way, 405 minutes of work, and recovery can only record "whether the side effects
ran is unknown".

Windows already has a working graceful channel: ``write_planned_stop_marker`` +
the in-process watcher in ``run.py``, which translates the marker into the same
shutdown-handler invocation a real SIGTERM produces on POSIX. ``hermes gateway
stop`` uses it. ``--replace`` did not.

These tests pin the request-then-escalate contract.
