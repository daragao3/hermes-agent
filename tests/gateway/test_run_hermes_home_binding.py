"""HERMES_HOME binding for ``gateway/run.py``'s module-level home snapshot.

``gateway/run.py`` resolved ``_hermes_home = get_hermes_home()`` at module
import — the original form of the bug class that
``concepts/import-time-hermes-home-snapshot-bug`` tracks.  ``tests/conftest.py``'s
autouse ``_hermetic_environment`` fixture redirects ``HERMES_HOME`` to a per-test
tempdir only AFTER collection has imported this module, so the snapshot held the
developer's real ``~/.hermes`` before the first test ran.

This is the largest instance on the repo: 65 use sites, and — unlike
``tui_gateway/server.py`` — it derives FURTHER module-level constants from the
snapshot, each of which is a second snapshot in its own right:

* ``_env_path = _hermes_home / '.env'`` (import-scoped; read by nothing, but
  seven existing tests ``monkeypatch.setattr`` it, so the name must survive);
* ``_config_path = _hermes_home / 'config.yaml'`` (import-scoped: consumed three
  lines later by the config->env bridge and never read again);
* ``GatewayRunner._VOICE_MODE_PATH`` (a genuine runtime second snapshot, read
  AND written long after import).

The destructive use sites are worse than the page's summary recorded.  Besides
``(_hermes_home / ".clean_shutdown").touch()`` and the ``.update_response``
unlinks, there are THREE ``mark_seen(_hermes_home / "config.yaml", FLAG)`` calls
— ``mark_seen`` is ``yaml.safe_load`` + ``atomic_config_write``, the exact writer
that destroyed the user's live ``~/.hermes/config.yaml`` on 2026-08-11.

``gateway/slash_commands.py`` copies the snapshot across the module boundary at
ten sites (``from gateway.run import _hermes_home``), the same shape ``entry.py``
had with ``_CRASH_LOG``.

Existing protection is ~150 ``monkeypatch``/``patch`` sites across ~40 files.
That is incidental, not structural: it is the same pattern that masked
``_save_cfg`` right up until that bug destroyed the live config.
