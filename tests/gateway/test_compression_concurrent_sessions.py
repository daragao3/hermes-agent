"""Behavioral tests for concurrent compression across distinct and shared sessions.

Complements ``test_compression_concurrent_fork.py`` (which tests the
agent-level lock against a real ``SessionDB``) by focusing on gateway-level
isolation guarantees:

1. Five distinct sessions compressing in parallel must not alias each other's
   session_ids (no cross-session contamination).
2. Two agents sharing the same session_id must serialize: exactly one rotates,
   the other returns its input unchanged (the no-op / lock-loser contract).

The stub-compressor pattern mirrors ``test_compression_concurrent_fork.py``:
the compressor returns deterministic output and sleeps briefly so threads
actually overlap at the OS level, making the absence of aliasing a genuine
stress test rather than a timing accident.
