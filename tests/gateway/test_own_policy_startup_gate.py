    ``start()`` calls ``events.gateway_integration.startup()`` inline and
    synchronously. That does real I/O against the **canonical** ~/.hermes event
    bus (13 subscribers, tracker-intent-applier rehydrate, a jobops :4100
    probe); notification state is cross-profile, so the ``tmp_path``
    HERMES_HOME above does not redirect it.

    ``test_gateway_allow_all_satisfies_yuanbao_open_gate`` reaches that call
    (its adapter stub returns None, so startup falls through to the running
    path) and paid **173s** on a loaded box for a policy-gate assertion that
    says nothing about the event bus. Its sibling exits at the gate first and
    ran in 0.7s — the whole difference is live-bus I/O.
