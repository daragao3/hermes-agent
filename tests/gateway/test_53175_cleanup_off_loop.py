"""Regression test for #53175: gateway event loop wedged by synchronous
agent-resource cleanup run inline from loop coroutines.

#35994 fixed the /new reset path, but the same synchronous
``_cleanup_agent_resources`` (agent.close() tears down terminal sandboxes /
browser daemons / background processes; shutdown_memory_provider() may do
SQLite / network IO via a memory plugin) was still called INLINE on the event
loop from three other places:

  * ``_session_housekeeping_watcher`` (the 5-minute idle sweep) — live loop
  * ``_handle_message_with_agent`` cache-hygiene re-eviction — live loop
  * ``_finalize_shutdown_agents`` / ``stop()`` idle-cache loop — shutdown

A wedged provider on any of these froze the whole loop: the bot went silent,
the runtime-status ``updated_at`` heartbeat stopped advancing (the symptom the
reporter's watchdog keyed on), and SIGTERM could not be serviced (requiring
``kill -9``).

The fix routes all four call sites through ``_cleanup_agent_resources_off_loop``
which offloads to a worker thread under a bounded ``asyncio.wait_for``, so the
loop is never blocked and a stuck teardown degrades gracefully.

These tests drive that shared helper directly — it is the single chokepoint
every fixed call site now uses.
