"""``--replace`` must not kill a gateway that is still booting.

The replace path terminates the incumbent named by the PID file
unconditionally: it reads ``existing_start_time`` purely as a PID-reuse guard
and never asks how old the incumbent is. So two operators (or two agent
sessions) deploying the same commit minutes apart each truncate the other's
boot — the second ``--replace`` SIGTERMs a process that has not yet bound
:8642, and the port stays dead through both attempts.

Observed 2026-08-14: PID 43052 started a ``--replace`` takeover at 20:14:26Z
and was killed at 20:15:37Z by a sibling session's ``--replace``, 66 seconds
into a boot that needs ~60-100s to bind. Neither launcher wrote a byte to its
log, so both sessions read the outage as a silent launch failure.

The watchdog already refuses to touch a ``gateway run`` younger than
``BOOT_INPROGRESS_GRACE_SECONDS`` for exactly this reason. These tests give
``--replace`` the equivalent.
