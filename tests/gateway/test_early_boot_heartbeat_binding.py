"""The early-boot heartbeat thread must stay bound to the home it started with.

``start_gateway`` starts a daemon thread that rewrites the gateway heartbeat
every 30s until ``runner.start()`` brings up the real writer. That thread can
outlive the scope that started it — ``_early_hb_stop.set()`` is skipped
entirely when ``runner.start()`` raises, and under pytest the thread outlives
the test's ``monkeypatch`` teardown either way.

If it resolves ``gateway_heartbeat_path()`` on every tick, the tick that lands
after teardown writes into whatever ``HERMES_HOME`` was *restored* to — the
real ``~/.hermes``. Five tests in ``tests/gateway/test_runner_startup_failures``
call ``start_gateway()`` directly, and they are startup-*failure* tests, so the
raising path is the one they exercise.

The rule (GBrain ``concepts/import-time-hermes-home-snapshot-bug``): resolve at
the moment the value's meaning is fixed, then CARRY it. For this thread that
moment is thread start — it is inside ``start_gateway``, well after any profile
override has set ``HERMES_HOME``, so capturing there is correct.
