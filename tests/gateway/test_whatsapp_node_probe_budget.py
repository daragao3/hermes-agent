"""The ``node --version`` probe in ``check_whatsapp_requirements`` must not
mistake host load for a missing Node.js install.

Observed 2026-08-11 23:23:47 on the live gateway: ``connect()`` logged
"Connecting to whatsapp" at 23:23:40.678 and "Node.js not found" at
23:23:47.102 — a 6.4s gap.  A genuine resolution miss returns in ~0.01s
(``find_node_executable`` is a path lookup), so the probe had in fact run and
blown its ``timeout=5`` budget; ``except Exception: return False`` turned that
into "not installed", and the caller stamped a ``whatsapp_node_missing`` fatal
with ``retryable=False``.  WhatsApp stayed down until the next gateway boot on
a box where Node was fine (v24.14.0).

Same spawn-cost trap as ``_kill_port_process``/``netstat`` (bff71e7ed) and
``gateway.status.pid_exists`` (e467da742): a 5s budget is not a bound on
process spawn under load on this host.

Both tests assert on a FLAG — the kwarg actually passed, and the branch
actually taken — never on elapsed wall-clock, which would pass on the broken
code whenever the box happened to be idle.

# ``--timeout-method=thread`` does not fail the test — ``pytest_timeout`` calls
# ``os._exit(1)``, killing the interpreter and destroying the summary line, so
# the runner parses the whole file as "no tests ran" (exactly the failure mode
# that hid all 469 ``tests/hermes_cli/test_web_server.py`` tests until
# 427bfa9b6f).  Ordinary unit tests reach it through
# ``load_gateway_config()`` -> ``_apply_env_overrides()`` ->
# ``deps_probe = entry.deps_available_fn or entry.check_fn`` — and
# ``tests/conftest.py``'s live-system guard does not stop it: that guard blocks
# package installs, remote-installer pipes and ``hermes update``, not a node
# version probe.  So the platform supplies a ``deps_available_fn`` that answers
# from the filesystem, and the spawning ``check_fn`` is left to ``connect()``.
