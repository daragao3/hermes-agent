"""Guard: no file in this repo may anchor a path by escaping the checkout
root with a hardcoded ``Path(__file__)`` hop count.

WHY THIS IS AUTOMATED. The defect has been introduced three times and
"fully enumerated" once — the census went stale in two days:

* 2026-08-11 — three sites fixed (``tests/cron/test_critic_skill_review_contract.py``,
  ``tests/devflow_delegation/test_roadmap_intake_migration.py``,
  ``tests/events/subscribers/test_cron_stale_monitor.py``) and the class was
  declared "fully enumerated for tests/".
* 2026-08-13 — ``0162e24718`` added ``tests/cron/test_jobflow_researcher_wake_gate.py``
  with the identical bug written from scratch.
* 2026-08-16 — fixed again (``704581c54b``, landed as ``5c4fb4223b``).

WHY IT KEEPS SLIPPING THROUGH. A hardcoded hop count is correct in exactly
one layout. From the main checkout ``agent-src/tests/cron/x.py``,
``parents[3]`` is ``~/.hermes`` — right. From a worktree at
``agent-src/.claude/worktrees/<name>/tests/cron/x.py`` the same expression is
``agent-src/.claude/worktrees`` — wrong, and the target artifact is absent.
So it PASSES in the main checkout where it was authored, and fails only for
whoever next works in a worktree, as a stable reproducible red that survives
a stash-and-compare and therefore gets written off as "pre-existing, not
mine". That is exactly what happened on 2026-08-16 on branch
``claude/intelligent-lamarr-ee488d``.

THE RULE. For a test at repo-relative path ``p``,
``Path(__file__).resolve().parents[N]`` is the checkout root when
``N == len(p.parts) - 1``. Anything LARGER escapes the checkout. Escaping is
not wrong per se — it is wrong *combined with a hardcoded count*, because the
distance to ``~/.hermes`` differs by 3 between the two layouts.

THE SANCTIONED FIX for a genuine hit is the in-repo ``_find_hermes_root()``
pattern: search upward from ``__file__`` for the ancestor that actually
contains the target artifact, plus a skip when it is absent. Use a
module-level ``pytest.skip(allow_module_level=True)`` only when EVERY test in
the file needs the artifact; if only some do, use ``pytest.mark.skipif`` on
those (see ``tests/events/subscribers/test_cron_stale_monitor.py``, where 8 of
9 tests are hermetic). Do NOT reach for ``git rev-parse --show-toplevel`` (it
returns the *worktree*, reproducing the bug) or
``hermes_constants.get_default_hermes_root()`` (it reads ``HERMES_HOME``,
which ``tests/conftest.py`` redirects to a per-test tempdir).

SCOPE — 2026-08-16: widened from ``tests/`` to the whole checkout. The
gateway is an editable install that imports the working tree, and tests
import those modules *from a worktree*, so a production module resolving
``~/.hermes`` by a hardcoded hop count breaks in exactly the same
layout-dependent way. The audit that motivated the widening found the
non-test tree clean (0 escapes out of 142 anchoring occurrences across 1148
files), so this half starts green and stays that way by assertion rather
than by census.

TWO SPELLINGS, because the widened scope changed which one dominates. Under
``tests/`` the subscript form (``parents[N]``) outnumbers the ``.parent``
chain 196:97. Under non-test code the ratio *inverts* to 21:121 — production
code overwhelmingly writes ``Path(__file__).parent.parent``. A subscript-only
detector would therefore have covered barely 15% of the anchoring surface it
was just pointed at, which is close enough to theatre to be worth the second
pattern. ``N`` chained ``.parent`` hops is ``parents[N-1]``; both forms are
normalised to a subscript index before the rule is applied, so there is one
rule and one boundary, not two.

KNOWN LIMITATION — deliberately narrow to stay false-positive free. The
detector only matches a hop count taken directly off a literal
``Path(__file__)``. It does NOT follow an alias
(``_THIS = Path(__file__).resolve()`` … ``_THIS.parents[2]``, as in
``tests/stress/test_atypical_scenarios.py``), and it does not look at hop
counts off an *imported module's* ``__file__`` (``test_gateway_diag.py``,
``test_update_autostash.py``, ``test_terminal_exit_scratch_binding.py``) —
those are depth-stable and a genuinely different class. Widening the pattern
was measured against the tree and rejected: it flags correct code. See
``test_alias_bound_dunder_file_is_a_documented_blind_spot``. Two further
spellings were swept by hand during the 2026-08-16 widening and left out of
the automation because the tree contains no instance of either: an
``os.path.dirname()`` nest around ``__file__`` (7 occurrences, max depth 3,
all landing at or inside the root) and a ``__file__``-adjacent ``".."``
literal (0 occurrences outside ``tests/``).

THE SCAN MUST PRUNE ``.claude``. From the main checkout, ``.claude/worktrees``
holds a sibling worktree per active session — each a full copy of this tree.
Walking them would (a) cost a multiple of the real tree and (b) measure their
files against the *outer* root, inflating every root-hop limit by 3 and
silently masking real violations. Both checkouts were verified to hold zero
``*.py`` under ``.claude`` outside ``worktrees``, so pruning the whole
directory loses nothing. See ``test_sibling_worktrees_are_pruned``.

FALSIFICATION (do not trust an empty result that was never proven to run).
Against a checkout of ``4b779c40e5`` this detector reports exactly one
violation — ``tests/cron/test_jobflow_researcher_wake_gate.py: parents[3]``
against a root-hop limit of 2. Against current HEAD both halves report zero,
out of 2511 test files (196 subscript + 97 chain occurrences) and 1148
non-test files (21 subscript + 121 chain). Every one of those six numbers has
a floor under it in ``TestScanIsNotVacuous``, so a broken glob, a wrong root
or a regex that stops matching cannot masquerade as a clean tree. The
widening was itself falsified by planting a violating module under
``gateway/`` and confirming this file goes red — not merely by observing that
it stays green.

THE SCAN JUDGES THE COMMITTED TREE, NOT THE WORKING FILES (2026-08-28).
This test reads ~3,700 files over a ~2–4s window, and on this box multiple
concurrent agent sessions rewrite files in the SHARED checkout while suites
run. A working-tree read can therefore observe a half-written file — an
undecodable or vanished file turns ``test_every_test_file_was_readable`` red,
and any transient state is judged as if it were the tree. So the scan now
pins ``HEAD`` once (``git rev-parse``), lists ``*.py`` blobs with ``git
ls-tree -r`` and reads them all through ONE ``git cat-file --batch`` process:
an immutable, internally consistent snapshot that no concurrent rewrite can
perturb. Measured 2026-08-28 on this box: per-file ``git show`` costs
108.5 ms/file (~407s for the tree — prohibitive, per-spawn cost on Windows);
one ``cat-file --batch`` pass reads all 3,750 blobs (73 MB) in ~3.5s,
comparable to the old 16-thread disk read.

DELIBERATE TRADE-OFF: an uncommitted (new or modified, unstaged or staged)
violation is invisible to a local run until it is committed. The guard's
history is violations that LANDED (see above — every incident was caught in
committed code), and the cron gates (``hermes_repo_test_gate.py``,
``nightly_gate.py``) judge committed trees, where HEAD content is exactly
what is under test. Nothing in the prior implementation deliberately targeted
uncommitted files — it read the working tree only because that is the
default spelling. When git is unavailable (not a repo, no git binary) the
scan falls back to the old working-tree walk; ``_Scan.source`` records which
path ran, and the fallback is pinned by
``TestScanJudgesTheCommittedTree::test_non_git_root_falls_back_to_the_working_tree``.
