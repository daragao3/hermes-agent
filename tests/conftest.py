"""Shared fixtures for the hermes-agent test suite.

Hermetic-test invariants enforced here (see AGENTS.md for rationale):

1. **No credential env vars.** All provider/credential-shaped env vars
   (ending in _API_KEY, _TOKEN, _SECRET, _PASSWORD, _CREDENTIALS, etc.)
   are unset before every test. Local developer keys cannot leak in.
2. **Isolated HERMES_HOME.** HERMES_HOME points to a per-test tempdir so
   code reading ``~/.hermes/*`` via ``get_hermes_home()`` can't see the
   real one. (We do NOT also redirect HOME — that broke subprocesses in
   CI. Code using ``Path.home() / ".hermes"`` instead of the canonical
   ``get_hermes_home()`` is a bug to fix at the callsite.)
3. **Deterministic runtime.** TZ=UTC, LANG=C.UTF-8, PYTHONHASHSEED=0.
4. **No HERMES_SESSION_* inheritance** — the agent's current gateway
   session must not leak into tests.
5. **No OTel span export.** HERMES_OTEL_DISABLE=1 is pinned at *import*
   time (see below), so nothing the suite imports can build a real span
   exporter aimed at the developer's Langfuse collector.

These invariants make the local test run match CI closely. Gaps that
remain (CPU count, xdist worker count) are addressed by the canonical
test runner at ``scripts/run_tests.sh``.

# ``get_tracer(...)`` at MODULE scope, which runs
# ``obs.otel_tracing.ensure_initialized()`` on import — i.e. during collection,
# before any fixture has run. By the time an autouse fixture could set this,
# the exporter and its atexit flush already exist, and spans opened during the
# run are POSTed after pytest has printed its green line.
#
# THIS IS DEFENCE IN DEPTH, NOT THE ONLY THING STANDING BETWEEN THE SUITE AND
# THE COLLECTOR. Measured 2026-09-03: with this pin removed, a traced module
# imported at collection still leaves ``_PROVIDER`` as None, because two other
# things already hold. ``_pin_hermes_home_before_collection()`` below runs at
# module level, and ``obs.otel_tracing._load_env_once()`` resolves its .env via
# ``get_hermes_home()`` rather than ``Path.home()`` (invariant 2's rule, applied
# at that callsite), so the real ~/.hermes/.env is never read and the
# LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY / LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY it carries never reach os.environ.
# Provider construction needs both keys, so it stops there.
#
# The pin is kept because it is the module's own documented hard-off switch and
# is checked BEFORE that .env read (obs/otel_tracing.py: the gate at the top of
# ``ensure_initialized`` short-circuits ahead of ``_load_env_once()``). It
# therefore does not depend on either of the above continuing to hold — and a
# host that does have LANGFUSE_* exported in the ambient shell is not covered by
# them at all.

# ── HERMES_HOME must be pinned at IMPORT time, not per test ────────────────
# The autouse ``_hermetic_environment`` fixture below redirects HERMES_HOME for
# every test, but a fixture is function-scoped: it cannot run until collection
# has already imported every test module. Several production modules do real
# work to the Hermes home *at import*, so by the time the first fixture fires,
# the damage is done and is process-wide:
#
#   * ``tools/approval.py`` ends with a module-level ``load_permanent_allowlist()``
#     -> ``load_config()`` -> ``ensure_hermes_home()``, which mkdir+chmods the
#     whole live tree (``cron/ sessions/ logs/ logs/curator/ memories/ pairing/
#     hooks/ image_cache/ audio_cache/ skills/``) and the ``~/.hermes`` root.
#   * ``hermes_cli/main.py`` calls ``setup_logging()`` at module level, which
#     attaches a RotatingFileHandler to the ROOT logger pointed at the real
#     ``logs/agent.log`` and sets ``hermes_logging._logging_initialized``. Every
#     later call is then a no-op, so *every log record the rest of the session
#     emits* — from any test — lands in the developer's production log. That is
#     how ``agent.log`` filled with test turns against fabricated providers, and
#     how a ``Shutdown watchdog fired after 0s`` CRITICAL line carrying a
#     ``pytest-of-<user>`` tmpdir path got into ``agent.log.3``/``errors.log.2``,
#     falsifying an absence proof drawn from grepping those logs.
#   * ``hermes_cli/banner.py``'s background update-check thread writes
#     ``profiles/<p>/.update_check``.
#
# Pinning the env var here — before pytest imports a single test module — makes
# all of them resolve into a throwaway directory instead. The per-test fixture
# still narrows HERMES_HOME to ``tmp_path`` for isolation between tests; this
# only closes the window that opens before any test exists.
#
# Verified with an audit hook (``tests/_live_root_audit.py``): 89 writes into
# the real home during collection alone, every one attributed to
# ``<import/collection>`` rather than to any test.

# usable". A distribution whose FILES were deleted but whose DIRECTORIES
# survive is imported by Python as an implicit PEP-420 namespace package: the

# see this — it explicitly suppresses the very ImportWarning that would reveal
# it ("ignore ImportWarnings that might happen because of existing directories
# with the same name we're trying to import but without a __init__.py",
# _pytest/outcomes.py) — and ``minversion`` is the only built-in escape.
#
# Cost of not guarding it, measured on 2026-08-17: a gutted numpy left 8 empty
# dirs in site-packages with no dist-info. ``importorskip("numpy")`` passed, so
# 8 tests that should have SKIPPED failed instead — and worse, the husk then sat
# in ``sys.modules`` where ``_pytest.python_api._as_numpy_array`` finds it
# ("and numpy is already imported") and calls ``np.isscalar``, so every
# ``pytest.approx`` for the rest of the session raised. That took down 14 more
# tests across four files with no numpy in them: 22 failures, one broken install.

# tempdir, and every production path resolves through
# ``hermes_state.py:229`` (``get_hermes_home() / "state.db"``). So an open of
# the live file means the isolation FAILED — a leaked env var, a module that
# cached the path at import time before the fixture ran, or a hardcoded path.
#
# That failure is silent today: the test passes, having read or written real
# data. This turns it into a loud, immediate RuntimeError.
#
# It rides the existing ``sqlite3.connect`` wrapper rather than adding a second
# one, for the reason stated above: one wrapper covers every call site in the
# suite without editing any of them, including connections opened at module
# import / collection time, which no fixture can see.

# ── inspect-source snapshot: first read wins for the whole session ──────────
# Multiple concurrent agent sessions rewrite files in this SHARED checkout
# while suites run, so a run-time read of a source file can observe a
# half-written file, or a NEWER file than the code this process imported.
# Six spellings of run-time source reads exist across ~119 test files
# (censused 2026-08-27, loops record tier4-hygiene-batch-20260827):
#
#   1. ``inspect.getsource`` / ``inspect.getsourcelines``   (the ~88% majority)
#   2. ``inspect.getsourcefile`` / ``inspect.getfile`` + an explicit read
#   3. ``Path(mod.__file__).read_text()``
#   4. bare ``open("pkg/mod.py")``
#   5. reads via ``<fn>.__code__.co_filename``
#   6. tree globs (``rglob``/``glob``, then read every hit)
#
# Only spelling 1 is intercepted here, because it has ONE choke point that can
# be pinned with zero call-site edits and zero behavior change when nothing
# rewrites files: ``inspect`` resolves source through ``linecache``, whose
# cache entries are ``(size, mtime, lines, fullname)`` 4-tuples — and
# ``linecache.checkcache`` (called by ``inspect.findsource`` on every
# getsource, and by traceback formatting) deliberately SKIPS entries whose
# ``mtime`` is ``None`` (the marker for loader-sourced files). So after the
# first successful getsource of a file, its linecache entry is rewritten with
# ``mtime=None``: the first-read snapshot then survives any on-disk rewrite
# for the rest of the process, and every later getsource sees the same bytes
# the first one saw — one consistent snapshot per file per session.
#
# Spellings 2–6 are deliberately NOT intercepted: hooking ``io.open`` /
# ``Path.read_text`` / glob machinery globally is far riskier than the
# disease, and ~88% of the reader files use spelling 1 against one pinned
# sibling module each. The two whole-tree readers are hardened separately:
# ``tests/test_test_path_anchoring.py`` judges committed blobs via git, and
# ``tests/gateway/conftest.py`` keys its cached verdict on content hashes.
#
# Concurrency: tests run one file per interpreter
# (scripts/run_tests_parallel.py) and pytest-xdist is not installed
# (pyproject dev deps), so this cache is per-process by construction; the
# RLock only covers tests that call getsource from their own threads, and
# re-entrancy (inspect.getsource calls inspect.getsourcelines, which is also
# wrapped).
#
# No test legitimately depends on a re-read: the only file mixing getsource
# with importlib.reload (tests/hermes_cli/test_ignore_user_config_flags.py)
# never rewrites the source it inspects (verified 2026-08-28).

    ``hermes_logging`` holds its file handlers in a module-global list
    (``_queued_file_handlers``) that a background ``QueueListener`` thread
    dispatches to. That global is correct in production — a process has one
    HERMES_HOME for its whole life — but every test here gets a *different*
    HERMES_HOME under its own ``tmp_path`` (see ``_hermetic_environment``),
    and ``tmp_path_retention_policy = "failed"`` deletes that directory the
    moment the test passes. A handler registered by one test therefore
    outlives its log directory, and the next test in the process that emits a
    record makes the listener thread write into a path that no longer exists::

        --- Logging error ---
        concurrent_log_handler ... FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file
        or directory: '...\\pytest-NNN\\test_xxx0\\hermes_test\\logs\\.__errors.lock'

    Because it is raised on the listener thread, that spew is attributed to no
    test and fails nothing — it just corrupts the output of whatever ran next.

    Resetting on *teardown* also lets pytest actually reclaim the tempdir: on
    Windows ``concurrent-log-handler`` keeps its ``.__<name>.lock`` file open
    for the handler's lifetime, and an open handle blocks the directory
    removal that the "failed" retention policy is there to perform.

    ``_logging_initialized`` is cleared alongside the handlers because
    ``setup_logging()`` checks it *before* registering agent.log/errors.log:
    left set with an empty handler list, the next test's ``setup_logging()``
    call would silently attach nothing. The two are reset together in

# ── Live-system guard ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Several test files exercise the gateway-restart / kill code paths
# (``cmd_update``, ``kill_gateway_processes``, ``stop_profile_gateway``).
# When a single test forgets to mock either ``os.kill`` or the global
# ``find_gateway_pids`` helper, the real call leaks out of the hermetic
# environment and finds the developer's live ``hermes-gateway`` process
# via ``psutil`` — sending it SIGTERM mid-test. The shutdown forensics in
# PR #23285 caught this happening 5+ times in 3 days, every time
# correlated with a ``tests/hermes_cli/`` pytest run starting up.
#
# This fixture makes the leak impossible by intercepting the two
# primitives that actually do damage:
#
#  • ``os.kill`` rejects any PID outside the test process subtree with
#    a hard ``RuntimeError`` so the offending test gets a stack trace
#    instead of silently murdering the real gateway.
#  • ``subprocess.run`` / ``subprocess.Popen`` / ``call`` / ``check_call`` /
#    ``check_output`` reject any ``systemctl ... <verb> hermes-gateway``
#    invocation that would mutate the live unit. Read-only systemctl
#    calls (``status``, ``show``, ``list-units``) still pass through.
#  • The same wrappers reject ``pip``/``uv pip``/``ensurepip``
#    install/uninstall commands aimed at the LIVE venv, so a test can
#    never pip-install into the environment the gateway runs from.
#    Installs redirected via ``--target``/``--prefix``/``--root``/
#    ``--python``, or run against another interpreter, pass through.
#  • The same wrappers reject a DIRECT gateway launch/stop —
#    ``hermes gateway run``, ``pythonw -m hermes_cli.main gateway run``,
#    ``python -m gateway.run``. This is the systemd guard's blind spot:
#    it keys on ``systemctl`` being present, so every detached-spawn path
#    (the only one Windows ever uses) went unchecked. A test that stubs
#    part of the launch surface and misses the branch the code actually
#    takes would silently leave a background gateway behind on the
#    developer's machine — see _is_gateway_lifecycle_cmd for the history.
#
# "Discovery without delivery is harmless" — the stance this comment held from
# 2026-05-10 — remains TRUE for signal safety: the ``os.kill`` guard above
# catches the actual signal call and the ``systemctl`` guard catches the systemd
# path, so a scanned PID is never signalled. It is NOT true for cost or
# determinism, which is why ``_pid_scan_guard`` below now defaults the host
# process-table scans to empty. Reversal approved by Diego 2026-08-15 on
# these measurements:
#
#   • Cost. ``_scan_gateway_pids`` returned the developer's LIVE gateway PID
#     [47164] in ~2–3 s per call standalone (2026-08-15), and 10–16 s per sweep
#     inside a loaded suite (2026-08-17: 34.03 s/3 sweeps in test_cron.py,
#     19.91 s/2 in test_gateway_windows.py, 15.62 s/1 in test_status.py).
#     ``addopts`` pins a 30 s per-test timeout that also covers fixture setup,
#     so one test reaching the scan twice (``gateway_windows.stop()`` does) can
#     consume the whole budget. Not a projection: while measuring this guard, an
#     UNGUARDED baseline run of test_cron.py was killed by pytest-timeout inside
#     ``subprocess.communicate`` under the real sweep, never reaching
#     ``sessionfinish``. Re-measuring this A/B therefore needs a raised
#     ``--timeout`` on BOTH arms or the baseline cannot finish at all.
#   • Determinism. The sweep finds whatever gateway happens to be running on the
#     machine, so an unstubbed test passes or fails on host state. ``HERMES_HOME``
#     is already tempdir-redirected by ``_hermetic_environment`` and
#     ``_get_service_pids`` is inert off Linux, so this sweep was the LAST way
#     the host leaked into a PID-path result.
#
# Only the sweep is stubbed, not ``find_gateway_pids``: that function's
# composition logic (PID-file merge, service PIDs, exclude/ancestor handling,
# restart-manager gating) stays under real coverage and simply sees an empty
# contribution from the process table, which is the correct hermetic default.
#
# ``hermes_cli.main._find_stale_dashboard_pids`` is the same hazard one notch
# sharper, and is guarded the same way (2026-08-17). It walks the host process
# table IN-PROCESS — ``psutil.process_iter(["pid","cmdline"])``, since Windows
# 11 dropped ``wmic`` — so there is no subprocess to intercept and the sweep
# probe written for the gateway scanner was structurally blind to it:
#
#   • Cost. 1011 host processes walked, 1.1–4.3 s per call standalone, and
#     1.5552 s / 670 processes inside the confirmed offender
#     (tests/hermes_cli/test_update_zip_symlink_reject.py::
#     test_update_via_zip_accepts_normal_member, which reaches it via
#     ``_update_via_zip`` -> ``_kill_stale_dashboard_processes``).
#   • Determinism AND delivery. Unlike the gateway sweep, this one is wired
#     straight to a killer: ``_kill_stale_dashboard_processes`` runs
#     ``subprocess.run(["taskkill", "/PID", pid, "/F"])`` for every PID it
#     returns. In the offender that was neutralised only by the test's own
#     broad ``patch("subprocess.run")`` — which ALSO stopped
#     ``_is_foreign_pid_kill`` below from ever evaluating the argv. Removing
#     that patch and calling the reaper for real (2026-08-17) produced

# ── PID-scan guards: arm at import, decide at call ─────────────────────────
#
# Each guarded scanner must be stubbed before any unmarked test can call it,
# WITHOUT importing its module anywhere in a test process. Both halves of that
# are hard constraints, and together they rule out the two obvious
# implementations (see the spec above for the full analysis):
#
#   • Importing the module in the autouse fixture costs 3.6 s and 463 modules
#     for ``hermes_cli.gateway`` (measured 2026-08-17) and pulls
#     ``agent.model_metadata`` into every trivial test — exactly what
#     tests/test_conftest_import_cost.py forbids. Note that test snapshots
#     ``sys.modules`` at ``pytest_sessionfinish``, so importing once at conftest
#     load instead of per-test fails it too. ``hermes_cli.main`` is cheaper
#     (2.1 s / 252 modules) and pulls none of that test's FORBIDDEN_PREFIXES,
#     so its *stated* assertion would pass — but the same test runs its child
#     pytest with ``-p import_probe``, and main's import-time
#     ``_apply_profile_override()`` reads ``-p`` as ``--profile`` and
#     ``sys.exit(1)``s, so the child aborts and ``returncode == 0`` fails. The
#     no-import rule holds for both modules, for two different reasons.
#   • A ``sys.modules.get`` lookup at fixture setup imports nothing, but leaves
#     the guard UNARMED whenever the module is not yet imported at that point.
#     That is the common case, and the runner gives each file its own process:
#     for ``hermes_cli.gateway`` 17 test files import it inside a function body
#     versus 15 at module scope; for ``hermes_cli.main`` it is 176 versus 136.
#
# So: patch at IMPORT time via a ``sys.meta_path`` finder, and choose real-vs-
# stub at CALL time from a flag the autouse fixture flips. The split is what
# makes the opt-out marker work when a marked test imports the module fresh
# inside its own body — an install-time decision would have to commit to one
# behaviour for the rest of the process.
# ``tests/test_windows_subprocess_no_window_flags.py::
# test_gateway_pid_scan_hides_wmic_and_powershell_windows`` is exactly that
# shape, so this is load-bearing rather than theoretical.
#
# Precedent, same mechanism, already in production on this branch:
# ``cli.py`` (~line 852) installs a meta_path finder that defers patching
# ``openai._base_client`` until first import, for the same reason — an eager
# import cost it did not want to pay. Divergence: that finder disarms and
# removes itself after firing because it patches a class once; this one stays
# armed so ``importlib.reload`` re-applies the guard, which is also why it
# delegates by walking ``sys.meta_path`` (skipping itself) instead of calling
# ``importlib.util.find_spec`` and needing a disarm to dodge recursion.
#
# Overhead measured 2026-08-17: 646 ns per ``find_spec`` call, 310 calls on the
# heaviest import chain in the repo = 0.2 ms per process.

# ── local-server probe guard: arm at import, decide at call ────────────────
#
# ``agent.model_metadata`` reaches the NETWORK to work out what model server is
# answering at ``base_url``. ``detect_local_server_type`` walks a five-endpoint
# waterfall (/api/v1/models, /api/tags, /v1/props, /props, /version) inside an
# ``httpx.Client(timeout=2.0)``, and ``_query_local_context_length`` opens its
# own ``timeout=3.0`` client on top of that.
#
# Where a closed port refuses instantly this is free, and therefore invisible.
# It is not free everywhere. Measured on this developer's box 2026-08-17: a
# closed local port returns its RST after ~2.02 s, not immediately (listening
# ports answer in ~0.001 s; 4000/11434/1234/8000/8080/54321 all take ~2.02 s,
# via 127.0.0.1 as well as localhost — so it is NOT the IPv6 dual-stack penalty
# ``_localhost_to_ipv4`` already guards). Every probe therefore burns its full
# ceiling: ~10 s per ``detect_local_server_type`` call, which puts a single test
# over the 30 s pytest-timeout cap.
#
# The failure that produced is worth stating, because it does not look like a
# network problem from the outside: pytest-timeout kills the process mid-file,
# so no summary line is printed, so the parallel runner buckets the file under
# "no tests ran (collection/import error …)". On 2026-08-17 that was 10 files —
# every one of which collected and ran fine, and none of which had an import
# error. ``tests/run_agent/test_streaming.py`` collected 53 tests and ran 172 s
# before it was killed.
#
# Stubbing to ``None`` is not a lie. ``None`` is exactly what both functions
# return on a machine with no local model server, which is what CI is and what
# the affected tests all assume — e.g.
# ``tests/run_agent/test_invalid_context_length_warning.py`` patches
# ``get_model_context_length`` intending to be offline, and simply misses this
# second path.
#
# Same arm-at-import / decide-at-call split as the gateway PID-scan guard
# above, for the same two reasons: ``agent.model_metadata`` is one of the
# expensive imports that guard's note measures (3.6 s / 463 modules), so the
# fixture must not import it; and test files import it inside function bodies
# as often as at module scope, so a ``sys.modules`` lookup at fixture setup
# would leave the common case unarmed.

    ``sqlite3.Connection`` keeps its prepared-statement cache in a reference
    cycle, so a connection a test opened and dropped is NOT freed by plain
    refcounting — it waits for a cyclic-GC pass. Until it is freed, its
    ``__del__`` has not closed the file, and on Windows the open handle blocks
    deletion of the directory holding the DB.

    ``tmp_path`` reclaims its directory with a best-effort
    ``rmtree(ignore_errors=True)``, so that failure is silent: the test passes
    and the tree survives in %TEMP% (30.4 GB / ~191K dirs by 2026-07-22).
    Because collection is timing-dependent, only *some* tests stranded a dir,
    which is why the leak looked erratic.

    ``tryfirst`` puts this ahead of pytest's own teardown, which is what
    finalizes fixtures — so the connections are closed while ``tmp_path``'s
    finalizer can still act on them. Deliberately NOT a fixture: an autouse
    fixture is set up before ``tmp_path`` and therefore torn down *after* it,
    and one depending on ``tmp_path`` would force a temp dir for every test.

    Purely a lifetime nudge — it never changes when anything commits, closes,
    or rolls back, so it cannot alter test semantics.

    **Only tests that could have created such a connection pay for it.** A full
    ``gc.collect()`` walks the whole tracked heap (61K objects at collection
    time, 211K by the end of ``tests/hermes_cli/test_doctor.py``) and cost
    0.163s per test — 16.0s of that 98-test file, charged to EVERY test in the
    repo. Only 10 of those 98 tests ever opened a sqlite connection.
    ``_sqlite_opened_since_collect`` (see ``sqlite3.connect`` wrapper above)
    gates the call: 12 collects instead of 98, 2.1s instead of 16.0s, with no
    change for any test that actually touches sqlite.

    The gate deliberately stays armed for ONE more test after the last open.
    Fixture finalizers run *after* this ``tryfirst`` hook, so a connection whose
    last reference lives in a fixture becomes collectable only once this
    teardown is over; the following test's collect is what frees it (the same
    ordering the unconditional version relied on).

    walks its own ancestors up out of the worktree until it finds

    That script's line 34 is::

    and sits AHEAD of the checkout under test. Every later first-time import of

    checkout instead of this worktree.

    Measured: after that file, ``events.subscribers.scribe_action_telemetry``
    resolved to the shared checkout, so a full-suite audit reported live-root
    writes from code that had already been fixed here. Worse, the repo runs
    ``pytest-randomly`` by default, so which tests get the deployed copy varies
    run to run -- a verification can pass or fail on ordering alone.
