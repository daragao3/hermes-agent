"""Regression: the autouse ``_reset_module_state`` fixture must not force heavy
imports during fixture setup.

Why this exists
---------------
``_reset_module_state`` (tests/conftest.py) clears process-global state between
tests. Each of its blocks used to do a plain ``from X import Y`` — which
*imports* the module purely in order to reset it. The worst offender was
``from agent import auxiliary_client``: it pulled ~950 modules (including the
whole ``openai`` type tree, 454 modules) into every pytest process during the
FIRST test's fixture setup.

``pyproject.toml`` sets ``--timeout=30``, and that cap covers fixture setup, so
on a cold filesystem the first test of a file was killed before its body ran,
with a faulthandler stack ending at the ``from agent import auxiliary_client``
line. Measured on a dev box: 22.4s of fixture setup for a file whose 25 tests
are pure string assertions.

The fixture's own docstring already stated the correct invariant — "Modules
that don't exist yet (test collection before production import) are skipped
silently — production import later creates fresh empty state." A module that
was never imported has no leaked state to clear, so the reset must be
*conditional on the module already being in* ``sys.modules`` rather than
importing it. That is both faster and semantically identical.

This test pins the invariant. It runs pytest in a SUBPROCESS on purpose:
``sys.modules`` is process-global, so a sibling test in this process that
legitimately imports ``openai`` would mask the regression entirely.
