"""Frozen, JSON-serializable records for the P6 fleet controller.

Everything here is immutable data. The planner consumes and produces these;
the controller serializes them into event payloads. No I/O, no clocks.

Payload hygiene contract (plan-approved): event payloads built from these
records carry process IDENTITIES (``pid:create_time``), never full command
lines, transcript contents, or anything credential-shaped. ``ProcessRecord``
itself keeps argv so the planner can classify — it just never leaves the
process through ``to_payload`` methods.
