"""Pure planning core for the P6 fleet controller.

PURITY CONTRACT (pinned by tests): this module imports nothing that can do
I/O and takes every changing input — the snapshot, transcripts, pressure
events, prior strike state, and ``now`` — as a parameter. Same inputs, same
plan, same digest, on any machine at any time.

The primitives generalize the two proven implementations on this box —
``scripts/reap_stray_tests.py`` (create-time-validated ancestry, default-deny
ownership) and the home-root ``cull-claude-sessions.py`` (CLI classification,
transcript-mtime idleness, two-strike keys, infra protection) — without
importing either. The old culler is import-unsafe (top-level psutil sweep)
and must never become a dependency.

    contradict each other.

    WHICH FIELD CARRIES THE AXIS (2026-09-01). ``payload['axes_latched']``
    when the producer stamps it, ``payload['reasons']`` otherwise.

    ``reasons`` lists only the axes breaching in THAT SAMPLE, and its
    omissions are not assertions. ResourcePressureMonitor latches axes
    independently and emits one multi-axis event per edge, so a disk-only
    emission during a live spawn-latency episode says nothing at all about
    spawn — yet reading ``reasons`` newest-wins turned that silence into
    ``disarmed``. MEASURED: 295 of 295 controller passes read ``disarmed``
    between 2026-08-31T14:41Z and 2026-09-01T20:00Z, pressure.valid TRUE on
    none of them, because the chronically-latched disk axis re-emits every
    ~15 min and overwrote all five spawn_latency events this box has ever
    produced. ``axes_latched`` is the producer's own ``_latched`` set — every
    axis whose episode is still open — so it answers the question this
    function is actually asking. Record: loops
    reaper-retirement-commit-gap-20260901.

    THIS WIDENS AUTHORIZATION, deliberately and boundedly. ``axes_latched`` is
    a superset of ``reasons``: it also holds an axis inside its hysteresis
    band (past its trigger earlier, not yet comfortably below its disarm).
    That is the producer's own definition of "the episode is not over", but it
    is a weaker signal than an active breach, so ``PressureEvidence.axis_source``
    records which one armed a given pass. It is audit only — the trigger does
    not read it — and it exists so the split can be measured off the
    CLAUDE_FLEET_PLAN events rather than argued about.

    The ``reasons`` fallback keeps every pre-2026-09-01 event, and any replay
