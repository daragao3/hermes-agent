"""One-pass orchestration for the P6 fleet controller.

The controller is the only module here that touches the live box: psutil
snapshots, transcript files, the EventBus, the state file, the singleton
lock. Every decision is delegated to the pure planner; every irreversible
action is delegated to the executor — and the executor is only ever
constructed inside the doubly-gated enforce branch.

Fail-closed inventory (each is pinned by a test):
  * unknown/malformed mode           -> behaves as disabled, exits quietly
  * malformed config values          -> exit 2, nothing touched
  * lock held by a live sibling      -> exit 3, nothing touched
  * EventBus unreachable             -> no trigger evidence, no action
  * corrupt state file               -> strikes reset, never inherited
  * state save failure               -> pass abandoned before any emission
  * enforce without BOTH gates       -> planner runs demoted to shadow
  * any revalidation mismatch        -> whole intent cancelled

    Phase 1 reads pid/name for every process and takes the whole pid->ppid
    table in ONE call. Phase 1b fills in ``create_time`` for
    ``planner.census_ctime_pids`` only. Phase 2 enriches ONLY the
    Claude-named processes and their trees (``planner.enrichment_pids``) with
    the remaining expensive fields (cmdline/exe/username/rss). Every one of
    those opens a per-process handle on Windows, so fetching them across the
    whole table costs tens of seconds — worst during the very churn storm P6
    exists to act on. Every process the planner actually classifies or
    protects is Claude-named or a descendant of one, so the majority never
    needs any of them.

    PPID WAS THE MISSED FIELD (2026-09-01), and it is not intuitive: ppid
    looks as cheap as pid or name, but psutil's Windows implementation has no
    per-process ppid — it takes a WHOLE-SYSTEM Toolhelp snapshot to answer
    each call, so asking every process is quadratic. Measured on this box,
    each the FIRST enumeration in a fresh interpreter (the scheduled task is
    always a fresh interpreter, so only first-call numbers are honest here):

        process_iter(pid)                          0.14s
        process_iter(pid, name)                    0.20s
        process_iter(pid, ppid, name)             56.48s
        _psutil_windows.ppid_map()                 0.06s   <- whole table, one call

    That is the same map, ~800x cheaper. Phase 1 now costs well under a
    second where it had grown to ~50s, which drove the controller's pass from
    a steady 15s past the task's PT4M30S ExecutionTimeLimit — killed by Task
    Scheduler (event 329) every cycle, so fleet growth disabled the guard
    that exists to contain fleet growth and its silence watchdog with it. See
    loops claim tray-329-kills-fleet-controller-20260901.

    BEWARE THE WARM/COLD TRAP that hid this: a SECOND process_iter in the
    same interpreter costs ~1-3s because psutil caches, so an A/B run inside
    one script credits whichever field set ran first with the entire cold
    cost. That mismeasurement first blamed create_time here. Compare field
    sets only across separate interpreters.

    A process that could not be enriched (access denied, recycled between
    phases) is marked incomplete, which protects its whole tree — fail-safe.
    A process whose create_time could not be READ is marked incomplete for
    the same reason -- but one that has EXITED between phases is dropped from
    the census instead, because the old single-phase census would never have
    listed it and an incomplete member protects its whole tree, so keeping
    dead rows would let ordinary churn quietly veto every cull. A process OUTSIDE the
    create_time closure keeps create_time 0.0 and stays complete, because it
    is never a tree member or an ancestor and so that field is never read for
    it; non-enriched, non-Claude processes keep empty expensive fields on the
    same argument."""
