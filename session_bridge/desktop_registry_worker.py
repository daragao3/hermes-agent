"""Continuous single-writer reconciliation of the Desktop session registries.

``DesktopRegistrySyncWorker`` is the durable driver around the pure planning
core in :mod:`session_bridge.desktop_registry`.  One cycle is::

    recover -> scan -> plan -> stage run -> apply -> rescan -> verify
            -> advance baselines -> record conflicts -> commit run

Baselines advance only for records whose intended group values verified on
every enrolled root, and only after the run's mutations were staged durably.
Because every individual file write is atomic (same-directory temporary plus
``os.replace``) and baselines advance last, an interrupted cycle needs no byte
replay: the stale run is abandoned with an audit trail and the next cycle
re-derives the remaining deltas from the standing baselines.  A scan that
cannot produce complete, stable evidence writes nothing.
