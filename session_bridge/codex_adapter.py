# Ceiling for a single READ-ONLY sidebar request (thread/list, thread/search,
# thread/read). Deliberately NOT _REQUEST_TIMEOUT: that constant also defaults
# the thread/start-side timeouts, where 30s is still right -- a creation call
# that hangs should fail fast, a census read should not.
#
# Measured 2026-09-01 against a live app-server (0.151.0-alpha.7.2, 4143
# enumerable active threads). A single thread/search for a marker prefix ranged
# 14s-101s, and the identical short term measured 2.19s / 56.72s / 2.97s within
# minutes -- latency does NOT track term length, process age, or corpus scan
# size, and the cause is not established. At 30.0 that distribution straddles
# the ceiling, so find_by_marker_including_archived was a coin flip: with the
# read budget raised but this left at 30.0 it passed 1 of 5 runs, and all four
# failures landed at exactly 30.1s. With this raised it passed 12 of 13.
#
# 120.0 buys headroom over the worst observed search without swallowing the
# caller: SidebarExecutor allows 240s for a whole operation
# (_operation_budget_seconds), so one request can still never take more than
# half of it. Raise THIS, not the read budget, if the marker path regresses --
# an unbounded budget alone provably does not help.

# Smallest remaining budget worth spending on a request. Below this the attempt
# cannot finish (a thread/list page costs ~0.3-0.4s against a live app-server),
# and issuing it anyway hands the transport a sub-second timeout whose error text
# then names THAT figure -- e.g. "thread/list timed out after 0.062s" on a call
# that is not slow. Refusing early keeps the failure attributable to the budget.

    """Two different bridge ids authenticate inside one codex thread.

    Public since 2026-09-07 because ``coordinator`` now imports it: the three
    codex scan paths must catch it narrowly, exactly as they already catch
    ``LocalSessionOwnsCanonicalId``, and exactly as the three claude paths catch
    ``ConflictingClaudeBridgeMarkers``. The name lost its leading underscore for
    that reason and nothing else -- it was module-private only because the two
    sidebar call sites below were its only consumers.

    THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY CORRUPTION, and that is why it must not be fatal.
    ``_detect_origin`` harvests markers from the text of ANY user record, so a
    thread that merely PRINTS or quotes marker strings collects them as if they
    were its own provenance -- and on this machine agent sessions work on the
    bridge itself constantly. The claude twin records the measurement that
    established this (three distinct markers on one transcript, one of them
    first appearing at record 356, which is the signature of a DISPLAYED marker
    rather than a second bridging).

    THERE ARE NOW THREE BEHAVIOURS FOR THIS CONDITION IN THIS CODEBASE, and
    which one applies is a property of the SURFACE, not of the thread. Say which
    one you mean before adding a fourth:

    * SIDEBAR VERIFICATION (``_verified_sidebar_projection`` path, ~line 430) is
      STRICT -- it converts this into ``SidebarVerificationError("marker_conflict")``
      and refuses. A binding oracle must not guess between two valid markers.
    * SIDEBAR INVENTORY (``_read_inventory_projections``, ~line 717) is
      PERMISSIVE -- it substitutes ``_conflicting_marker_projection``, a synthetic
      projection re-encoding both payloads so the thread still LISTS. Note it
      sets no origin at all: that is a display accommodation, NOT codex having
      answered the origin question.
    * SCAN / INDEX (the three ``coordinator`` codex paths, 2026-09-07) SKIPS,
      matching the three claude paths. The thread stays out of the catalog,
      ``ScanSummary.failed`` is untouched, and the skip is reported under
      ``codex_conflicting_bridge_markers``.

    Origin is deliberately NOT decided here on any of the three. Diego closed
    that question on 2026-09-07 for the claude side -- a NATIVE fallback was
    offered and DECLINED, as was a fourth ``origin_kind`` -- because
    native-with-no-bridge-id is the PERMISSIVE state in every consumer
    (``mirror.py`` and ``claude_visibility.py`` both gate on exactly "is not
    NATIVE or origin_bridge_id set"). The codex side follows that decision.

    Subclasses ``ValueError`` so every existing caller and test that matches on
    the type or the message is unaffected; the message is unchanged.
