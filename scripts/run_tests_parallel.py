"""Per-file parallel test runner.

The minimum-viable replacement for pytest-xdist + a subprocess-isolation
plugin. Discovers test files under ``tests/`` (excluding integration/e2e
unless explicitly requested), then runs one ``python -m pytest <file>``
subprocess per file, with bounded parallelism (default: ``os.cpu_count()``).

Concurrency is bounded twice over. ``-j`` bounds THIS invocation; a
machine-global slot limiter bounds every invocation on the host together,
so two concurrent runs take turns instead of stacking to 2x the core
count. A commit-charge gate additionally holds off a spawn while memory
is tight. See the "Host-saturation guards" block below for why both exist
(2026-08-12: ~50 stacked workers starved a dashboard boot for 29 minutes).

Why per-file rather than per-test?
    Per-test spawn overhead (~250ms × 17k tests = 70min CPU minimum)
    swamped the actual work. Per-file spawn (~250ms × ~850 files = ~3.5min)
    fits in the budget while still giving every file a fresh Python
    interpreter — the only isolation boundary that actually matters
    (cross-file module-level state leakage was the original flake source;
    intra-file state is the test author's responsibility).

Why drop xdist entirely?
    xdist's persistent workers accumulate state across files, which is
    exactly the leakage we wanted to fix. xdist also adds complexity
    (loadfile vs loadscope, --max-worker-restart, internal control plane)
    that we don't need when the unit of work is "run pytest on one file".
    A subprocess.Popen pool gated by a semaphore is ~60 lines and does
    the job.

Usage:
    python scripts/run_tests_parallel.py [pytest_args...]

    Common pytest args pass through to each per-file pytest invocation
    (e.g. ``-q``, ``-v``, ``-x``, ``--tb=long``, ``-k 'pattern'``, ``--lf``)
    with no special separator — a bare ``-q`` "just works". Anything after
    a literal ``--`` is also passed through, and stacks with bare flags.

Environment:
    HERMES_TEST_WORKERS  Override worker count (default: os.cpu_count())
    HERMES_TEST_PATHS    Override discovery roots (colon-sep; on Windows
                         ';' also works and drive letters are handled;
                         default: 'tests')

    NOTE: scripts/run_tests.sh execs this script under ``env -i`` with an
    explicit allowlist, so a variable only reaches us if that allowlist
    names it. The host-saturation guards are therefore configured by CLI
    flag (--no-host-limit / --host-slots / --min-free-commit-gb), not by
    environment, and key their state off ``Path.home()`` — one of the few
    things that survives the clean environment.

Exit code: 0 if every file's pytest exited 0; 1 otherwise.

# Per-file wall-clock cap. Override
# via --file-timeout or HERMES_TEST_FILE_TIMEOUT.
#
# Deliberately generous: a large-collection file pays interpreter startup
# plus a heavy import graph before any test logic runs, and that overhead
# dilates under load, producing false "no tests ran" timeouts on files that
# finish comfortably on a quiet box. The Docker build matrix jobs take 7-10
# min anyway, so this headroom costs nothing on total CI wall time while
# keeping a genuinely hung file bounded.
#
# Raised 300s -> 1800s on 2026-08-12, from measurement. The 300s value was
# reached by exactly the reasoning above but set below what this hardware
# actually needs. A full `tests/hermes_cli` run (467 files, ~8770 tests, -j 8
# on 12 cores) put 28 files in the "no tests ran" bucket. Re-running just
# those 28 with the cap lifted and retries off gave max 664.3s, p90 557.2s,
# median 95.4s -- only 4 of 28 over 300s, so most were killed for being slow
# under sustained load rather than being slow in themselves.
#
# Do NOT re-derive this from "observed max x margin": on this box the same
# file's wall time swings hard with ambient load, and not monotonically with
# -j. `test_web_server.py` finished inside 664s in a 28-file -j 8 batch and
# took 1234.3s in a 4-file -j 4 batch. An intermediate 1200s trial still
# killed it. Treat any single number as a lower bound on what a legitimate
# file can take here.
#
# 1800s is therefore chosen as "well past any plausible legitimate run" rather
# than as a tight fit. That is the right bias, because the two failure modes
# are wildly asymmetric:
#
#   too tight -> SIGKILL the tree, report "no tests ran", and silently discard
#                every real result in the file. Measured cost of the 300s cap:
#                `test_commands.py` reported nothing while actually passing
#                175/175 (647.1s), and `test_config.py` reported nothing while
#                actually surfacing 11 genuine failures (1090.2s). A green-
#                looking run was hiding real red.
#   too loose -> one worker of 8 idles until a genuinely hung file is killed.
#
# The cap's job is bounding a hang, not policing slowness. Prefer masking
# nothing.

# ── Host-saturation guards ──────────────────────────────────────────────
# On 2026-08-12 a Hermes dashboard startup was starved for 29 minutes and
# died without ever reaching its uvicorn bind: 5.1s CPU / 3 threads / 83MB
# RSS after 29 min, against 6.1s / 6 threads / 110MB for a healthy boot.
# RSS *below* the healthy figure is the tell — the working set was never
# faulted in. That is thrashing, not a deadlock.
#
# The trigger was ~50 concurrent pytest subprocesses on a 12-core box.
# Nothing here could have produced 50 from one invocation (the old default
# topped out at cpu_count*2 = 24), so at least two invocations stacked.
# Three separate gaps allowed it, and each has its own guard below:
#
#   1. The default was cpu_count*2 despite the docstring promising
#      cpu_count. -j 24 is known to oversubscribe this host; the failure
#      tail vanishes at -j 12.  →  _default_worker_count()
#   2. Nothing coordinated across invocations, and a per-process
#      semaphore cannot: the stacking runs live in different worktrees,
#      in different shells, with no shared parent.  →  _acquire_global_slot()
#   3. Nothing consulted memory pressure, even though the resource that
#      actually ran out was commit charge, not CPU.  →  _await_commit_headroom()
#
# Why file locks rather than a named semaphore or a PID registry: an OS
# file lock is released by the kernel when the holding process dies, however
# it dies. A registry of PIDs (or a counter file) would need stale-entry
# reaping, and a reaper that runs while the box is thrashing is exactly the
# code least likely to get scheduled. Ctrl-C'ing a run must never wedge the
# host, and with file locks that is a property of the kernel, not of our
# cleanup path.

# Machine-global slot directory. This must sit OUTSIDE any repo: the
# invocations we need to serialize typically run in different git
# worktrees, so a repo-relative path would give each its own private
# limiter and coordinate nothing.
#
# ``Path.home()`` (not an env var) is deliberate. scripts/run_tests.sh
# execs the runner under ``env -i`` with a fixed allowlist, so almost
# every HERMES_* variable is stripped before main() ever sees it —
# HOME/USERPROFILE are among the few that survive. A limiter keyed on an
# env var would silently no-op through the primary entry point.
