"""ResourcePressureMonitor — emits RESOURCE_PRESSURE on system-resource exhaustion.

Sibling of GatewayHealthMonitor: where that producer watches WhatsApp/Telegram
connectivity, this one watches the *host's* commit charge, physical RAM,
pagefile allocation, and C: free space, and fires a high-priority alert BEFORE
the disk gets eaten or paging takes services down.

Why this exists
---------------
On 2026-06-11 the machine's commit charge climbed to 84.2/85.6 GB (98.4%) and
Windows expanded ``pagefile.sys`` from 36 GB to 54.4 GB in ~22 minutes,
consuming ~18 GB of C: — with ZERO alerting. Windows' own
Resource-Exhaustion-Detector logged nothing, and the gateway's only health
signal (GatewayHealthMonitor) was busy chattering ``watchdog_burst`` events
about platform probes while the disk bled out. This monitor closes that gap.

How metrics are sampled (and why NOT via WMI)
---------------------------------------------
The failure mode is commit-charge exhaustion, so the sampler must NOT itself
commit much memory — spawning ``wmic`` / ``Get-CimInstance`` to read WMI costs
~50-100 MB per sample and can fail with ERROR_COMMITMENT_LIMIT exactly when we
most need the alert (``wmic`` is also being removed on Windows 11 26200). So we
read the same numbers WMI would report, but in-process via
``kernel32.GlobalMemoryStatusEx`` and ``shutil.disk_usage`` — no subprocess:

  * commit limit  == ``MEMORYSTATUSEX.ullTotalPageFile``
                     (byte-identical to Win32_OperatingSystem.TotalVirtualMemorySize KB * 1024)
  * commit avail  == ``MEMORYSTATUSEX.ullAvailPageFile``
                     (== Win32_OperatingSystem.FreeVirtualMemory KB * 1024)
  * commit used   == limit - avail
  * pagefile alloc ~= ``ullTotalPageFile - ullTotalPhys`` (the pagefile's
                     contribution to the commit limit; tracks
                     Win32_PageFileUsage.AllocatedBaseSize — on the incident
                     machine 85.6 - 31 ~= 54.6 GB, matching the recorded 54.4)
  * phys total    == ``ullTotalPhys``   (physical RAM installed)
  * phys avail    == ``ullAvailPhys``   (== psutil.virtual_memory().available)
  * C: free       == ``shutil.disk_usage(SystemDrive).free``

The physical-RAM axis was added 2026-07-16: a paging storm (phys 96.4%,
Docker/PG down, laptop-monitor healthy-count collapsing to 2-9/75 twice in one
day) produced ZERO events here because commit charge sat at 50-73% throughout —
the monitor was blind to the axis that actually killed services.

The spawn-latency axis (2026-08-27) exists for the same reason one generation
later: on 2026-08-26 a fleet of 84 concurrent agent sessions drove ~576
process creations+deaths per MINUTE and the box starved on PROCESS CHURN — a
trivial ``date`` took 11.8s, a CreateProcess round trip medianed 2.3s, and
the session reaper NO-OPed five times in a row — while commit read 74.7%
(ten points below its gate) and phys 89% (three below its trigger). Every
axis above measures memory or disk; nothing measured the resource that
actually saturated. This axis measures it directly: a rate-limited
CreateProcess round-trip probe (``SpawnLatencyProbe``), classified on
SUSTAINED readings so one slow spawn (a Defender cold scan, a disk hiccup)
never fires. Complementary to laptop-monitor's "Claude session fleet size"
tray row, which watches the fleet COUNT; this axis watches the churn COST.
Loops claim ``host-spawn-churn-20260826`` holds the full forensics.
DETECTION ONLY, like every axis here: it emits ``resource_pressure`` and
stops — no auto-kill, no gating; escalation rides the normal event routing.

``psutil`` is a hard dependency too, but its ``virtual_memory()`` reports
physical RAM (not commit) and its ``swap_memory()`` interpretation of the
pagefile is version-dependent; GlobalMemoryStatusEx is the precise, stable
source for the commit numbers this alert is about.

Emission policy
---------------
Edge-triggered with hysteresis and a re-alert cooldown (mirrors the gateway
lag-alert pattern): fire once on the rising edge of each axis, stay quiet
while that axis persists, and re-ping every ``re_alert_cooldown_seconds`` if
the episode drags on. The edge is PER AXIS — an axis that breaches while
another is already latched emits immediately rather than waiting out the
cooldown, because a new axis is new information and axes no longer share a
severity class (disk_critical pages; disk_low does not). A breached axis stays latched
until it is *comfortably* clear of its trigger — its disarm level, e.g.
commit back below 80% against the 85% trigger — and the episode only ends
once every latched axis has cleared; then the next rising edge fires
immediately. The disarm gap exists because re-arming at the trigger itself
let threshold hover storm: on 2026-06-11 22:52-23:21Z commit oscillated
84.x<->85.x and fired six alerts in 29 minutes, each dip re-arming the edge
and each re-cross sidestepping the cooldown. Genuine recovery keeps the
immediate-fire property; hovering at the threshold does not.

      reading a storm should produce.
    * The probe measures the round trip a real tool call pays (create +
      child run + exit), not the bare CreateProcess return — that is the
      quantity whose degradation times out harness tools and feeds the
      taskkill amplifier.
