"""CronEventEmitter -- emits lifecycle events from the cron execution pipeline.

Hooks into the cron scheduler's tick()/run_job() cycle to emit:
  - cron_started: before job execution
  - cron_completed: after successful execution
  - cron_failed: after failed execution
  - cron_failed_consecutive: when consecutive failures reach threshold
  - agent_failure_cluster: when 3 consecutive same-type failures occur
    for a single source (Hermes Revival §6 post-hoc Critic trigger)

Domain events (job_discovered, job_scored, etc.) come from MailboxTranslator
consuming mailbox_message events — see events/subscribers/mailbox_translator.py.
