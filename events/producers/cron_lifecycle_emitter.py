"""Cron lifecycle emitter — one event per pause/resume state transition.

The sibling of :mod:`events.producers.cron_trigger_emitter`. That one records
a fire the schedule did not ask for; this one records the schedule being
switched off and back on.

Called by ``cron.jobs.pause_job`` / ``resume_job`` (and by ``trigger_job``,
which implicitly un-pauses) AFTER the job record has been written. Defensive
for the same reason as the trigger emitter: an unhealthy event bus must never
be able to break a pause. The state mutation is already durable by the time
this runs, so a swallowed failure is a missing audit record, never a job left
in a half-changed state.

    """Return ``(caller, caller_source)``, never a null or blank caller.

    ``caller`` is the single field the whole CRON_PAUSED/CRON_RESUMED feature
    exists to provide, and until 2026-08-26 it could be null: ``pause_job`` /
    ``resume_job`` / ``trigger_job`` all warn on an anonymous call but do not
    refuse, so any code importing ``cron.jobs`` and calling ``resume_job(jid)``
    bare wrote a well-formed, audit-logged, *unattributed* event. That is not
    hypothetical — three Gate-2 containment-hold jobs were released that way at
    01:17 EDT and landed on the bus as ``caller=None`` while every sanctioned
    resume beside them read ``hermes_cli:cron_resume``. The event's ``source``
    field carries the JOB NAME, not the actor, so it cannot substitute.

    Resolution order, first non-blank wins:

    1. the threaded ``caller`` argument       -> ``THREADED``
    2. ``$HERMES_CALLER``                     -> ``DERIVED``
    3. ``script:<basename(sys.argv[0])>``     -> ``DERIVED``
    4. :data:`UNKNOWN_SCRIPT`                 -> ``DERIVED``

    Two properties are load-bearing:

    ``caller_source`` travels with the value. A derived caller is real evidence
    (for the incident above it reads ``script:gate2_resume_barrier_set.py``,
    which names the actor) but it is weaker than a threaded one, and a reader
    who cannot tell them apart is worse off than one staring at an obvious
    null. Never label a derivation ``THREADED``.

    The env var is a fallback, NOT an override. If ``$HERMES_CALLER`` could
    rewrite a caller a call site threaded correctly, ambient process state
    could forge attribution — strictly worse than the null it replaces.

    Deliberately NOT a required-keyword refusal. That design was tried on
    2026-08-25 for ``pause_jobs_cas``/``restore_jobs_cas`` on the premise that
    they had no landed consumer; the premise was false, the tracked tracker
    quarantine adapter called both without a caller, and it raised TypeError
    unnoticed for a day. A signature break lands on exactly the out-of-repo
    scripts that are the hole, at runtime, mid-operation. The anonymous-call
    warnings in ``cron.jobs`` stay: deriving a value makes the record usable,
    it does not make threading a caller optional in new code.
