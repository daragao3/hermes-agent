"""CodeDriftMonitor — emits CODE_DRIFT when a deployed checkout drifts from trunk.

Two repos on this box are "production by working tree":

1. ~/.hermes/agent-src (trunk `main`) — the gateway's editable install
   imports the WORKING TREE of this shared checkout, which is deliberately
   kept on a detached HEAD so worktree agents can land commits onto the
   `main` ref via `git branch -f`. A commit landed on main therefore does
   NOT run until the checkout is fast-forwarded and the gateway restarted —
   on 2026-07-20/21 three restart cycles ran stale code while every session
   believed the fix was live because "main tip moved".

2. ~/.hermes itself (trunk `master`) — cron script-slot jobs and Windows
   Scheduled Tasks resolve ABSOLUTE paths under ~/.hermes/scripts/,
   ~/.hermes/profiles/*/scripts/ and ~/.hermes/ops/. Landing a commit on
   master does not deploy it there; only the working tree runs. On
   2026-07-28, 62 commits sat undeployed for three days behind a clean
   `git status` because the live checkout had been pointed off master.

Per-repo trunk ref names are NOT optional decoration. Until 2026-07-28 this
monitor hardcoded `refs/heads/main` and watched agent-src alone. ~/.hermes
has no `main` branch, so simply adding the path without its trunk name
would make every probe fail the ref lookup and — under the old code —
return None, i.e. report "nothing to evaluate" forever. That is why a repo
whose CONFIGURED trunk ref does not exist is now a loud
state="trunk_missing" event rather than a silent skip. Operational Git
failures remain no-ops so the poll loop never fabricates drift or recovery.

Two local layers already surface this (laptop-monitor tray row,
events_doctor); this producer is the third: drift as an event-bus event so
it reaches Telegram when the operator is away from the machine.

Emission policy
---------------
Edge-triggered on the WALL clock (state is persisted across restarts):
fire on the rising edge of drift, fire when source/deployment condition
changes (not when commit counts change), re-ping a sustained episode every 6 h, and
emit a single status="resolved" event on the falling edge — but only if
the episode actually alerted. Episode state lives in
~/.hermes/notifications/code_drift_state.json so the resolved ping
survives the common remediation path (FF, then restart the gateway).

Read-only git, bounded subprocess (15 s timeout). The monitor NEVER
fast-forwards — remediation is a deliberate operator action.
