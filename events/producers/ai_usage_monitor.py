"""Resident AI-usage collection, run inside the gateway instead of by a task.

WHY THIS EXISTS. ``AIUsageCollector`` is a Windows scheduled task that cold-starts
a fresh interpreter per sample. At the task's BelowNormal priority the import
prefix ALONE was measured at 344.24s against a 340s usable window -- so the run
could die before ``collect()`` was ever reached, writing nothing at all: no
snapshot, no diagnostics, just a stale ai-tokens.json. Cadence PT5M -> PT15M
(2026-08-26) cut the exposure from 288 to 96 cold starts/day but did not remove
the class. Holding the interpreter resident does: imports are paid once per
gateway lifetime and cached in ``sys.modules``, and the same warm process keeps
httpx's SSL context (13.28s import + 4.22s first Client, both one-time).

WHY NOT A CRON JOB. Hermes cron script jobs shell out -- ``cron/scheduler.py``
builds ``argv = [python_exe, str(path)]`` and runs it through
``run_text_capture``. That is a cold interpreter start per fire, i.e. exactly
the thing being removed. The in-gateway monitors driven from the subscriber
poll loop (health, resource pressure, code drift, partial backlog) are the
mechanism that actually stays warm.

WHY check() DOES NOT DO THE WORK. That poll loop is shared and sequential: every
monitor's ``check()`` runs inline on the one thread that also services lag
checks, health checks and mailbox scans. A collector run is 40-60s of network
plus a CDP browser probe. Running it inline would stall the bus for a minute
every interval. So ``check()`` is a clock comparison that hands off to a daemon
worker and returns; results are reaped on a later tick. At most one run is ever
in flight -- a slow run causes a SKIP, never a pile-up, which is the same
guarantee ``MultipleInstancesPolicy=IgnoreNew`` gave at the task boundary.

SHADOW MODE. Default is ``shadow``: the resident run writes to a SEPARATE path
and the scheduled task keeps owning the real ai-tokens.json, so the two can be
diffed over a day before anything is cut over. ``off`` disables it entirely.
Only ``on`` writes the production snapshot, and only then should the scheduled
task be disabled -- two writers would otherwise fight over one file.
