"""Noise guards for chat delivery (v3 principle P4/P6: silence is not a
message; a flap is one incident, not N messages).

Three guards, all applied by TelegramNotifier BEFORE delivery (events
always stay on the bus for audit/critic consumers — these only gate chat):

  * is_noop_cron_output(): the measured 93%-of-cron-firehose case —
    ``[SILENT]`` markers, empty output, "no work". Content after a
    marker survives (a real error inside a [SILENT]-prefixed run must
    not be swallowed).
  * RepeatGuard: verbatim-repeat suppression per (thread, text) within a
    window — the "devflow-bridge: [SILENT]" ×1,522/week class, and
    defense-in-depth against WAL-contention redelivery floods
    (2026-04-28 incident shape).
  * FlapGuard: state-transition collapse for up/down signals — the
    WhatsApp-bridge flap delivered 898 alternating messages/week.

A fourth concept lives here because it is the same kind of decision:

  * is_off_ladder_consecutive_failure(): cron_failed_consecutive is a
    MONOTONE ESCALATING signal, not a flapping one, and RepeatGuard
    cannot see that — normalize_for_fingerprint() collapses the one
    field that carries the severity (``consecutive_errors``) to "N".
    The ladder makes the producer effectively rising-edge: only
    3, 6, 12, 24, 48 ... reach chat, and those bypass RepeatGuard
    because the ladder IS their rate limit.

Why both were needed (2026-08-25 postmortem). During the Docker outage
postgres-sync emitted 22 cron_failed_consecutive events at
priority=critical over 4h17m, reaching consecutive_errors=15. Four were
delivered. Three of those four were accidents — a gateway restart wiping
this module's in-memory state, and the error STRING changing — not
severity. The v3 design foresaw the normalization tradeoff
(docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-18-notification-routing-v3-design.md,
"a WARN that worsens only numerically ... is suppressed; rising-edge
producers + 30-min window bound the delay") but both halves of that
mitigation were false here: this producer is not rising-edge (it
re-emits on every failure), and the window did not bound the delay
because it SLID — every suppressed hit re-stamped it, and the job failed
every ~13-15 min, inside the 30-min window, indefinitely. The result was
that a four-hour outage was QUIETER than a transient blip, because by
then the guard was warm.
