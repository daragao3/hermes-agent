"""Attention-first routing policy — the single source of truth for
"where does this event go, and does it page the operator's phone?"

Design: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-18-notification-routing-v3-design.md
(in the ~/.hermes parent repo). Both delivery subscribers (TelegramNotifier,
WhatsAppEscalator) consult classify(); neither keeps its own event table.
That kills the drift that produced the pre-v3 mess: five independently
patched decision points (TOPIC_ROUTING + resolve_target overrides +
CROSS_POST_TO_ALERTS + the escalator's _TIER_BY_EVENT + ScribeRealtime
narration) delivering one interview_signal to three Telegram topics.

Model
-----
Every event gets an attention class — the operator-first question:

  ACT   Diego must do something (approve, decide, unblock, respond).
        Always lands in the cross-domain ``action_required`` topic and
        always escalates to WhatsApp.
  WARN  Something is broken/degraded. Lands in ``watchdog_alerts`` (or
        ``security_and_system`` for the security domain); escalates to
        WhatsApp only at CRITICAL or via an explicit per-type override.
  INFO  Meaningful progress worth seeing today. Domain topic.
  TRACE Telemetry. Domain firehose, batched below HIGH priority.

Invariants (enforced by tests/events/test_routing_policy.py):
  * every EventType classifies (no silent "system" catch-all);
  * ACT routes to action_required and escalates (immediate|urgent);
  * effective priority is clamped: ACT >= HIGH, WARN >= NORMAL;
  * INFO/TRACE never escalate unless explicitly flagged phone-worthy;
  * only TRACE routes may batch.
