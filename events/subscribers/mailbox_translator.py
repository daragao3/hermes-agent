"""MailboxTranslator — converts mailbox_message events into typed domain events.

Subscribes to mailbox_message (produced by MailboxWatcher) and emits
typed JOB_SCORED, JOB_HIGH_SCORE, APPLICATION_SUBMITTED, STAGE_TRANSITION,
etc. based on the message_type + inner payload.

This subscriber replaces the dead regex-based output parser in
CronEventEmitter that was never producing domain events.

Failure-cluster wiring (Hermes Revival §6 post-hoc Critic trigger):
the ERROR-message branch also feeds FailureClusterDetector so that
agents reporting failures via structured mailbox messages (not via a
non-zero cron exit code) still trigger AGENT_FAILURE_CLUSTER.  This
closes a gap from the cron-emitter wiring (events/producers/cron_emitter.py)
which only saw failures that surfaced as cron exit codes.
