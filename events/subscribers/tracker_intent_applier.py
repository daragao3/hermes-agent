"""Gateway subscriber wrapping IntentApplier (Task 7).

Adapts the filesystem-driven ``IntentApplier`` (Task 6) to the gateway's
subscriber lifecycle. Polls the tracker mailbox inbox at a short cadence
(default 1 s) and applies new intent files. The applier itself is the
unit of business logic; this file only adapts subscriber lifecycle
(poll/handle/startup/shutdown) to it.

Adaptation choice — Option A (override ``poll()``):
    ``BaseSubscriber.poll()`` is a regular method (not ``@final``), and
    the gateway poll loop in ``events/gateway_integration.py`` discards
    its ``int`` return value. This subscriber is filesystem-driven, not
    event-bus-driven, so we replace ``poll()`` entirely rather than
    consuming-and-ignoring events from the bus (which would still cost
    a SQL query per tick and pollute the per-subscriber cursor).

    The base class circuit breaker only fires inside the bus-event loop,
    so overriding ``poll()`` bypasses it — but ``IntentApplier`` has its
    own circuit breaker (Task 4) that wraps JobOps writes, so coverage is
    preserved at a more useful layer.
