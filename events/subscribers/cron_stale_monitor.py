"""CronStaleMonitor subscriber (SR-106) — detects cron jobs that never finish.

Watches CRON_STARTED / CRON_COMPLETED / CRON_FAILED and emits a CRON_STALE
event when a started job has no matching completion after STALE_THRESHOLD_SECONDS.
At most one CRON_STALE is emitted per stuck run; a subsequent CRON_COMPLETED
or CRON_FAILED for the same job_id clears the state so a *new* run that also
goes stale will alert again.

Why this exists: scheduler.run_job() invokes agents synchronously in-process,
so there is no subprocess heartbeat we can read.  If the job thread wedges or
the gateway dies mid-run, CRON_STARTED is recorded but the matching terminal
event never arrives.  This subscriber closes that observability gap.

It ALSO watches the ticker heartbeat itself (``_check_ticker_stale``).  The
job-level check above is blind to a dead *scheduler*: it only ever alerts on a
job that STARTED and never finished, so when the ticker thread itself dies no
CRON_STARTED is ever emitted, ``_open_jobs`` stays empty and nothing fires.
That is precisely how the 2026-08-11 outage ran 5h08m — the gateway process
alive and this subscriber polling beside it — with zero of 69 cron jobs
running.  The ticker heartbeat file is the one signal that survives that
failure, because nothing refreshes it once the thread is gone.

Three checks, on three clocks.  ``_check_stale`` and ``_check_ticker_stale``
run per poll, on this process's own state.  The third runs ONCE, in
``startup()``: it rebuilds the shutdown attributions a force-killed
predecessor never got to write, by querying the bus rather than by handling
events.  That one needs no in-memory state at all, which is exactly why it
works where ``handle()`` cannot.
