"""Base subscriber class and registry for the Hermes Event Bus.

Subscribers independently consume events from the bus via poll().
Each subscriber tracks its own cursor so multiple subscribers
can process the same events without interference.

Circuit breaker: if a subscriber's handle() raises CIRCUIT_BREAKER_ERROR_THRESHOLD
times in a row, the subscriber enters quarantine for CIRCUIT_BREAKER_COOLDOWN_SECONDS.
During quarantine, poll() is a no-op — events pile up in the backlog (visible via
subscriber_lag) instead of repeatedly invoking a broken handler.  A single
agent_error event is emitted on the transition into quarantine.

Cycle-prevention rule (2026-04-30): no subscriber that EMITS a delivery
event (NOTIFICATION_DELIVERED / NOTIFICATION_FAILED) may CONSUME a
delivery event. Today this applies to telegram-notifier and whatsapp-
escalator: each emits the reverse signal from inside _deliver(), and
each guards against consuming the type at the top of handle(). If you
add a third delivery subscriber, it MUST follow the same pattern.
Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-30-notification-delivered-design.md.
