"""TelegramNotifier subscriber — routes events to Telegram forum topics.

v3 (2026-07-18): ALL routing decisions live in events.routing_policy —
this subscriber owns delivery mechanics only (verbosity gate, noise
guards, batching, sends, reverse signals). One event → exactly one
Telegram message (cross-posting removed); noise guards enforce P4/P6
(no no-op messages, no verbatim repeats, flaps collapse to incidents).
Design: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-18-notification-routing-v3-design.md
(~/.hermes parent repo).

Reads topic registry from ~/.hermes/telegram/topics.json and verbosity
config from ~/.hermes/telegram/verbosity.json.  Delivers messages via
the gateway's Telegram adapter send() method.

        requeue on False, mirroring WhatsAppEscalator's quiet-queue requeue).

        When ``event`` is provided (non-batched delivery from handle()),
        emits NOTIFICATION_DELIVERED on success and NOTIFICATION_FAILED
        on exception, carrying original_event_id + target metadata.
        Both reverse-signal emits are wrapped in helpers that swallow
        their own exceptions, so a bus-side failure (transient SQLite
        lock, schema mismatch) NEVER breaks the upstream delivery path.

        Batched flushes (_flush_batch_key) call this without an event
        so per-event reverse signals don't double the LOW-priority
        firehose volume — Phase 1 scoping per the design doc at
        docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-30-notification-delivered-design.md.
        They pass ``batch_count`` instead, and a successful flush emits
        ONE synthetic NOTIFICATION_DELIVERED with
        original_event_type="batch_flush" (routing-v3 observability gap,
        2026-07-20: without it a "Batched (N events)" chat message left
        zero ledger rows, so per-topic delivery audits undercounted).

        ``buttons``, when provided, is the serializable spec from
        ``events.override_buttons.buttons_for`` and is forwarded to
        ``_deliver_result`` (the production path here, since ``_send_fn``
        is unset outside tests). It is never passed to ``_send_fn``, so a
        test double's call signature is unaffected. Defaults to ``None``,
        in which case this method's behavior is unchanged from before this
        parameter existed.
