"""Model rate-limit episode tracking and alerting.

Detectors across the agent runtime call :func:`record` when a model becomes
unavailable due to a rate limit, credit exhaustion, or usage cap. This module
coalesces those hits into *episodes* keyed ``(provider, model)`` and emits at
most one ``MODEL_RATE_LIMITED`` event per genuine change in the failure's
shape — so a two-hour outage produces one alert, not hundreds.

Design constraints (mirrors events/loop_fault.py):
* Best-effort: never raises, never blocks. Called from the agent's hot
  failover path. Every failure degrades to a debug log.
* Lazy bus access: the agent runtime has no events imports at module scope.
* Fail open: unreadable or malformed state means "no episode", never an
  exception and never a blocked model call.

State is deliberately FILE-backed rather than in-process: every cron spawns a
fresh process, so an in-memory cooldown (like ``agent._rate_limited_until``)
dies with it and each run rediscovers the same rate limit. Generalizes the
pattern already proven in agent/nous_rate_guard.py.

Cache coherence rule
--------------------
Two requirements pull in opposite directions:

* Losing persistence must never AMPLIFY alerts. If the cache were dropped
  whenever a write failed, every subsequent hit would re-read ``{}``,
  ``_should_alert(None, ...)`` would return True, and the anti-flood feature
  would itself become the flood — one HIGH-priority Telegram message (and, at
  ``chain_exhausted``, one WhatsApp page) per API call.
* A long-lived process must still SEE episodes other processes wrote. The
  gateway runs for days; crons are one-shot. A cache that is never refreshed
  makes every gateway write a whole-file replace built from a stale snapshot,
  silently deleting the crons' episodes and re-alerting them as brand new.

The rule that satisfies both: the cache is a snapshot ANCHORED to the state
file's identity marker ``(st_mtime_ns, st_size)`` as of the last moment this
process was in sync with the file.

  * no cache yet                      -> read the file, anchor the marker
  * marker == the file's current stat -> nobody has touched the file since we
                                         synced, so the cache IS the truth
                                         (this is what preserves a mutation the
                                         disk rejected: a failed write leaves
                                         the file — and therefore the marker —
                                         untouched)
  * marker != the file's current stat -> another process wrote; re-read and
                                         re-anchor, which is what makes foreign
                                         episodes visible

A FAILED write therefore publishes its mutated state into the cache but
deliberately does NOT advance the marker. A SUCCESSFUL write publishes and
re-anchors.

A FAILED read is handled differently depending on WHY it failed:

  * A missing file (``FileNotFoundError``) is legitimate empty state — it is
    anchored exactly like a successful read of ``{}``.
  * Any OTHER read failure — permission error, a sharing violation racing
    another process's ``atomic_replace``, a decode error, malformed JSON —
    means this process never actually saw the file's true contents. The
    marker is therefore deliberately left UNANCHORED (mismatched), not pinned
    to a file we failed to read. Two things follow:

    1. The cache still serves a fail-open ``{}`` for this call, but that
       ``{}`` is marked UNRELIABLE (``_state_reliable()``). ``record()`` and
       ``clear()`` refuse to run the destructive whole-file ``_save_state()``
       over unreliable state — they fall back to ``_publish_unsaved()``
       instead, exactly as they do for a failed write. Without this, one
       transient read failure (an AV scan, an indexer, a momentary sharing
       violation on a file another process is mid-``atomic_replace`` on)
       would let the very next write silently delete every episode another
       process had persisted — I4's harm, through a different door, caused
       by a read rather than a write.
    2. Because the marker stays unanchored, the NEXT ``_load_state()`` call
       retries the read instead of trusting the fail-open ``{}`` forever —
       but retries are bounded to at most once per
       ``_READ_FAILURE_RETRY_SECONDS``. Without that bound, a genuinely
       persistent failure (a permanently corrupt file) would re-attempt, and
       re-alert from a fresh ``{}``, once per hit — the same flood I1 exists
       to prevent, by a different door. Inside the backoff window the process
       keeps reusing its own in-memory mutations (published via
       ``_publish_unsaved``), so ``_should_alert`` still coalesces repeat
       hits even though the file itself was never re-read.

Known imperfections, stated rather than hidden:

1. If our write fails and a FOREIGN process then writes the file, the marker
   changes, we reload from disk, and our un-persisted mutation is discarded —
   which can permit one extra alert. That is bounded by foreign writes, not by
   hit rate, so it cannot flood.
2. ``(st_mtime_ns, st_size)`` can collide if a foreign write lands within the
   filesystem's timestamp granularity AND produces a byte-identical length. The
   consequence is one missed refresh — strictly better than today's "never
   refresh".
3. The marker is not a lock. Two processes writing concurrently still last-write-
   wins; this rule narrows the window from "the whole process lifetime" to "one
   read-modify-write", it does not close it.
4. The same discard as #1 applies when a failed READ is followed, after the
   backoff window, by a successful read: the fresh disk contents replace our
   in-memory-only mutation. Bounded by the retry interval, not by hit rate,
   for the same reason #1 cannot flood.

    Added 2026-09-13 for the report-only usage poller. It evaluates a whole
    snapshot at once, and calling :func:`record` per provider produced one
    MODEL_RATE_LIMITED page PER PROVIDER for a single condition: on
    2026-09-13 anthropic2, deepseek, openai-codex, kimi and anthropic each
    paged separately within one poll cycle.

    Each hit is still recorded through :func:`record` (``emit=False``), so
    the per-(provider, model) episodes in the state file are unchanged for
    their other readers. The batch itself is a further episode keyed
    ``(episode_provider, episode_model)`` -- stable across polls, so one
    condition is one episode -- whose ``members`` map records the outcome
    last alerted per member. The consolidated event fires only when the SET
    ESCALATES: a member appears that was not in the episode, or a member's
    outcome worsens (diverted -> chain_exhausted). A member dropping out
    updates the map silently, and an empty batch is a no-op -- the poller
    never calls clear(), and forgetting the episode on a quiet snapshot
    would re-page the same set the moment it reappeared. The episode's 6h
    TTL (``_EPISODE_MAX_AGE_SECONDS``) bounds how long an unchanged set stays
    silent, exactly as it does for a single provider.

    ``hits`` are dicts with ``provider``, ``model``, ``outcome`` and
    optionally ``resets_at``, ``label`` and ``detail``; the last two are
    display-only and pass straight through into ``payload["providers"]``.
