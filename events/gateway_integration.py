# default, ceiling 300s).  Past that grace the stopper's terminate_pid(force=True)
# is a TerminateProcess walk (hermes_cli._subprocess_compat.windows_kill_process_
# tree) that completes in well under a second and grants nothing; the 30s figure

    ``gateway/run.py`` emits GATEWAY_STOPPED early in its stop path and calls
    :func:`shutdown` late in ``main()``. Without this drain, delivery inside
    that window depends on the poll loop happening to tick before the bus
    closes. What that buys is a RECORD: AuditLogger writing the shutdown event
    into audit.jsonl, and the other subscribers seeing whatever else landed
    during teardown.

    ⚠ **It is NOT what makes the cron shutdown-attribution work, despite what
    bc07363000's commit message claims.** That commit justified this drain by
    ``CronStaleMonitor`` needing to see GATEWAY_STOPPED before the process
    died. The premise was falsified on 2026-08-17: PID 10168 was force-killed
    INSIDE ``_drain_active_agents`` — it logged ``notify_active_sessions done
    at +1.76s`` and never ``drain done`` — so this function never ran, and two
    genuinely-killed crons went unreported. The general form outlives both the
    2026-08-17 re-ordering of the stop budgets and the 2026-09-18 removal of
    the 30s ``taskkill`` timeout (``_TASKKILL_TIMEOUT_S``): whatever cuts a
    teardown short — the shutdown watchdog's ``os._exit(1)`` past
    ``agent.restart_drain_timeout + 60s``, or the stopper's tree kill past
    ``_windows_stop_drain_timeout()`` (a sub-second TerminateProcess walk with
    no grace of its own) — fires precisely while a drain is still waiting on
    live work, so any hook at or after the drain is reachable only when the
    drain ended early, i.e. only when nothing was killed and there is nothing
    to report. Attribution therefore moved to the SUCCESSOR, rebuilt from the
    bus in ``CronStaleMonitor.startup()`` (517cc56c97), where it needs nothing
    from this path at all. Do not re-derive a shutdown-time reporting hook from
    that commit message; it has been tried and measured.

    GATEWAY_STOPPED consumers go FIRST and are never skipped; the rest are
    best-effort under ``timeout_seconds``. The deadline gates whether a
    subscriber is STARTED, not how long it may take — a single wedged

    The applier is filesystem-driven and latency-sensitive: an operator
    approval lands as an intent file that must be applied within the
    dashboard's ~90s fast-revert window, or postgres-sync reverts the stage
    and the old-stage/revert bug reappears. Running it inside the shared
    ``_subscriber_poll_loop`` starved it for MINUTES during gateway restarts
    (proven live 2026-07-13): WhatsApp connect blocks ~30s and Telegram
    reconnects with ConnectionReset storms, and both subscribers are
    registered AHEAD of the applier, so they monopolise the single serial
    thread while intents sit unapplied. This dedicated thread guarantees the
    applier's ~1s scan cadence independent of the other 12 subscribers and the
    periodic maintenance blocks (health check, mailbox scan, WhatsApp flush).

    ``IntentApplier`` is single-threaded by design (``is_applied`` /
    ``mark_applied`` and ``_move_to`` are not race-free against concurrent
    callers). This thread is the SOLE driver of the applier —
    ``_subscriber_poll_loop`` skips the applier subscriber precisely so the
    two never both poll it. The direct ``_applier_subscriber`` reference (not
    a ``_registry`` scan) also keeps this loop ticking even if the serial loop
    is wedged iterating a slow subscriber.

    Mirrors ``_subscriber_poll_loop``'s outer-try safety net: any exception
    from a single scan is logged and swallowed so the thread keeps ticking
    rather than dying silently (the 2026-04-16 silent-failure mode).
