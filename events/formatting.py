# ── runtime drift signal (report, never repair) ─────────────────────────────
#
# EVENT_TYPE_EMOJI has drifted from EventType four times (2026-04-27 twice,
# 2026-05-29, 2026-08-11 — the last hid all twelve DevFlow Delegation Plane
# icons for five days). events.coverage now guards that pairing, but only where
# a developer is: the pre-commit hook, pytest, `python -m events.coverage`. All
# three are bypassed by `git commit --no-verify` and by any checkout where
# pre-commit was never installed, and none of them make a *running gateway* say
# anything — event_icon() just returns "" and the header renders with a
# double-space gap.
#
# So the process shipping the incomplete table reports it, once, at import.
# A Workday listbox answer is matched against the tenant's OWN option text, so
# an answer that is not verbatim one of these labels is never clicked: the run
# re-stalls looking exactly like nobody answered. The labels therefore have to
# reach Diego intact, which is what BLOCKED_QUESTION's `options` key carries
# (applier `blocked_question_payload`, MailboxTranslator `_blocked_question_
# options`). Rendering them as a numbered list rather than an inline comma run
# is not cosmetic: `question` is capped at MailboxWatcher._summarize's 200
# chars, and the Capital One list measured exactly 200 inside it -- one longer
# tenant list and the tail is lost to an ellipsis.
