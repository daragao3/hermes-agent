    Each member is a tuple of (event_type_string, default_priority, icon).

    The icon is a REQUIRED member field, on purpose
    -----------------------------------------------
    It used to live in a parallel ``EVENT_TYPE_EMOJI`` dict in
    events/formatting.py, which drifted out of sync with this enum FOUR times
    (2026-04-27 twice, 2026-05-29, 2026-08-11). Each time a member landed with
    complete schema + routing_policy entries but no icon, ``event_icon()``
    returned "" and the event rendered in Telegram with a double-space gap in
    the header. The last one hid all twelve DevFlow Delegation Plane types for
    five days.

    Nothing caught it earlier: ruff F601/F602 structurally cannot see it (the
    dict keys were EventType attribute accesses, not string literals), and a
    test only fires after the member has already landed on a branch.

    Making the icon a required member field removes the failure mode instead of
    detecting it: "an EventType with no icon" is now unrepresentable. Omitting
    the third element is a TypeError at class-creation time, so ``import
    events.schema`` fails outright — and every producer imports events.schema,
    not events.formatting, which is exactly why the old placement let authors
    ship green. Passing "" or "   " is the ValueError in ``__init__`` below.
    Neither can be bypassed by ``--no-verify`` or by a path that never runs
    pre-commit. ``EVENT_TYPE_EMOJI`` is now a read-only view derived from this
    enum; there is no second table to keep in sync.

    Adding a member? Pick a glyph disjoint from its neighbours in the same
    Telegram topic, and put the rationale for any non-obvious pick in a comment
    right above the member.

    STILL NOT A ONE-FILE CHANGE. The routing table is a separate, genuinely
    partial table and is NOT enforced here — ``classify()`` degrades to
    WARN-on-watchdog_alerts for an unmapped type by design, and turning that
    into an import-time raise would trade a cosmetic routing defect for a
    gateway that will not boot. So it stays a check rather than a constructor
    invariant:

        events/routing_policy.py _POLICY          (topic + WhatsApp tier)

    Run

        python -m events.coverage

    which is also wired as a pre-commit hook, and see events/coverage.py for
    the manifest of which tables must be total and which are deliberately
    partial.

    # routed through update_job, which has no emit path, so a paused job left
    # no record of the transition anywhere. Two independent investigations of
    # the 2026-08-24/25 jobflow/jaum/tracker pause churn (eight rows paused and
    # resumed repeatedly) tried to attribute it from audit.jsonl and from agent
    # transcripts and both failed, for the simple reason that there was nothing
    # to find. The job RECORD gained the WHY in cfe15649ad (paused_reason,
    # archived to paused_history on resume); these two carry the TRANSITION.
    #
    # Payload (both): job_id, job_name, caller, reason, paused_at,
    # previous_state, new_state — plus next_run_at on resume. ``reason`` is the
    # PAUSE's why in both directions: on resume it is the reason being retired,
    # which is what makes a pause/resume span readable from either end.
    # ``previous_state`` is what separates a real transition from a repeat
    # pause of an already-paused job — the shape the churn investigation
    # needed and could not get. LOW priority, same as CRON_TRIGGERED: the

    # Added 2026-08-26: the AUTHORIZATION half, distinct from the pause half
    # above. A resume_barrier is a durable condition on a job ("do not run
    # until X"); setting or lifting one is not a schedule transition and must
    # not be recorded as a pause, so it gets its own pair rather than reusing
    # CRON_PAUSED/CRON_RESUMED.
    #
    # These exist because of a measured failure of the pause pair. On
    # 2026-08-26T05:17:33-35Z the three Gate-2 barrier jobs were resumed by
    # bin/gate2_resume_barrier_set.py, a sanctioned tool -- which at that
    # moment omitted its caller= argument (added at 01:27:44 EDT, ~10 min
    # after). The resulting caller=None on three CRON_RESUMED rows was
    # indistinguishable on the bus from an unattributed actor, and TWO
    # sessions independently read it as an unsanctioned bypass and acted on
    # that reading -- one re-pausing all three jobs, reversing an operator
    # override. The events were emitted correctly; the ATTRIBUTION was empty,
    # and an empty attribution is not neutral, it actively misleads.
    #
    # Hence: cron.jobs.set_resume_barrier / clear_resume_barrier REFUSE a
    # blank caller outright rather than warning, so these two can never carry
    # caller=None the way that CRON_RESUMED trio did.
    #
    # Payload (both): job_id, job_name, caller, action, reason, barrier_reason,
    # barrier_set_at, barrier_set_by. On "barrier_set" ``reason`` IS the new
    # barrier's condition. On "barrier_cleared" ``reason`` is the
    # JUSTIFICATION for lifting -- the evidence the condition is now met --
    # while barrier_* carry the barrier being retired, so the set/clear span
    # reads from either end without joining to the job record.
    #
    # ASYMMETRIC ON PURPOSE, Diego's call 2026-08-26. Setting a barrier ADDS
    # protection and is routine, so it stays LOW/TRACE with the rest of the
    # cron lifecycle family. Clearing one REMOVES protection, and that is the
    # action this whole saga was about being invisible or misattributed -- so
    # it is promoted to HIGH/WARN and routed to watchdog_alerts, where it
    # reaches him directly rather than sitting in the firehose.
    #
    # The asymmetry is the point: an audit trail nobody reads is only useful
    # after the fact, and every expensive hour of 2026-08-26 was spent AFTER
    # the fact. A lift is rare -- a handful ever, each one deliberate -- so
